              "'ell, thank you very much. And hello, Tupelo. This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi. The great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley. But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family and country. Right? Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor, Republican Tate Reeves. Great guy. Great guy. Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before. We\\'re now an economic powerhouse. We\\'ve never been in a position like it. We\\'ve rebuilt our military and we have financial strength. And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401ks, the stock market hit, today, another all-time historic high. Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded. That\\'s not bad. That\\'s not bad when you\\'re on the debate stage and you say, \"We have the best economy we\\'ve ever had. We have the best military we\\'ve ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers we\\'ve ever had.\" Said, \"Got the best president we\\'ve ever had.\" Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Thank you very much. And very importantly, we\\'ve confirmed more than 158 brand new, beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. In a very short while, we\\'ll have 182 federal judges. President Obama left us 142. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Can you believe that? You\\'re supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn\\'t work out too well. And just days ago, the United States brought the world\\'s number one terrorist leader to justice. We have great military. It was very, very depleted. When I came into office, it was very, very depleted, but it ain\\'t depleted anymore. Yep. al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader… Look, you\\'ve heard about it for a long time. I kept saying, \"Where is al-Baghdadi? That\\'s the one I want. Where is he?\" And then, by the way, the following day, we got number two. I don\\'t know if you read about that. But he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and he\\'s dead. And Baghdadi, he was a Savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over. American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell, I guess you could say. He spent his last miserable moments on Earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there going right up. No enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the United States military, and Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you. And our military loves Mississippi. America is winning again, and America is all, over the world, respected again. It\\'s about time. But while we\\'re creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat party has gone completely insane. The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize. We are the ones standing in their way, and we will never get out of their way. It will be easy. From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media right back there… Look at all of them, oh. It\\'s too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn\\'t, they wouldn\\'t be here. Look at how many. It\\'s like the Academy Awards before it failed. Right? And you know why it failed? Because they disrespected us. But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership, trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary. You see what\\'s going on. First, they engineered the Russia hoax. That was a total hoax, the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people. Then the Mueller witch hunt, it never ended. With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget, let\\'s go get him. That didn\\'t work out too well, did it? That fizzled. And a lot of bad people along the way. And now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi- … and shifty Adam Schiff, Shifty. And the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt. This is one I never thought I\\'d be involved in. The word impeachment… To me, it\\'s a dirty word, not a good word. Totally phony deal. They know it. Everybody knows it, and that\\'s why we\\'ve never had greater support than we have right now. It\\'s true. And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside. You\\'ll see a lot more people trying to get in. So if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out. Anybody want to leave? Because there really is. There\\'s no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and to also, at the same time, be very serious than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi. We could have done this one on Monday night. I said, \"Let\\'s do Friday.\" Right? Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They\\'ve been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won. But the people here that are highly sophisticated, though, long before I won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared, \"The campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun.\" At least they gave us 19 minutes. Yesterday\\'s vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself. But I\\'ll tell you, the Republicans are really strong, the strongest I\\'ve ever seen them, the most unified I\\'ve ever seen them. Right? The most unified I\\'ve ever seen them. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism. The Democrats\\' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020. Make no mistake. They are coming after the Republican party and me because I\\'m fighting for you. They don\\'t like it. This is different. They\\'ve never had anything like this. Well, they\\'ve never had an election like 2016 either, have they? They never have. They\\'ve never quite figured it out. You\\'re the man. And they know they can\\'t win, so let\\'s try and impeach him. How about that crazy representative, Al Green, right? \"You know, we got to impeach him because we can\\'t beat him.\" I don\\'t think so. Right? I don\\'t think so. Al Green, he\\'s another beauty. The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us. And it\\'s not me, it\\'s us. It\\'s all of us. It\\'s 63 million, but it\\'s much more than 63 million. Much more. And right now, our numbers are higher than they\\'ve ever been before. They\\'ve never been this high. But they want to stop us because they know we are here, and that\\'s what we\\'re doing, and that\\'s what\\'s taking up so much time. We\\'re draining the swamp in Washington. Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying… Spying. They actually spied on my campaign. Can you believe it? I mean, you know, they try and say, \"Well, we were actually just checking things out. Oh, that\\'s wonderful.\" The lying, the falsifying over the past three years plus, before I ever even announced they were spying. I guess they knew we were going to win, right? But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed. And remember this, that truth is a force of nature. Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens, just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary\\'s shocking and very many misdeeds. 33,000 emails. 33,000 emails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter\\'s wedding. 33. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. She\\'s a beauty. How about last week? Did you hear? I don\\'t know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing. She\\'s not an agent of Russia. And Jill Stein, she\\'s a greenie. That\\'s fine. We love the environment, everybody in this room. You know, right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we\\'ve ever had, and yet we\\'re number one in the world in energy, by far. We took over. But I don\\'t know Jill Stein. She ran last time. I don\\'t know, but I know she\\'s not an agent of Russia. And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, \"They work for Russia, they\\'re agents of…\" I said, \"You know, when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement.\" She made it about them. Everybody laughed because of what we proved. But I\\'ll tell you what, these are very bad people. These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them. But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle. I\\'ve just beaten, with no… Look, look, we didn\\'t have too much political experience. I did a good job, built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business. Just did one show. It was called The Apprentice, and it was a big success. 14 seasons. And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over. It didn\\'t do too well. It was dead. It was dead from the first episode. I saw him, I said, \"Oh, it\\'s terrible. What have they done to this beautiful show?\" Arnold? But think of it. I\\'ve just beaten, with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack Hussein Obama dynasty. And President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right? He was all over the place. It\\'s the only time I\\'ve actually seen him work hard, when it came to trying to beat Trump. True. True. Remember he said… Remember he said, \"He will not be president\"? Well, that didn\\'t work out so well. And then they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonesty, right, with the lying and the spying and the leaking. And we are kicking their ass. I\\'ll tell you. In the delusional Democrat fantasy, I\\'m now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe. I used to call him 1% because you could never get 1% in the primaries. Then he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became vice president. But we\\'ve now named him Very Slow, Sleepy Joe. Very slow. He\\'s gotten slower and slower. I\\'m afraid if he gets a nomination, he\\'ll be so slow we\\'ll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked Hillary. In fact, I don\\'t even think that Sleepy Joe will get it. But many people are running. So, you know, it\\'s so early. I don\\'t want to talk about their campaign. Oh, did you hear Beto? Beto? Did you hear Beto? Beto. Oh, that poor bastard. Well, poor, pathetic guy. He was pathetic. Remember the arms a-flailing? Remember that? You know, he ran against Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won. He spent almost 100 million dollars, and Ted Cruz… And I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good. But I used to watch him. Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables. He was standing on countertops. I said, \"Does he ever stand on the floor and speak?\" But he\\'s waving his arms and going crazy, and I said, \"What the hell is he doing? What is he on?\" And do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this? Anybody that says he was born for this, they\\'re in trouble. I used to have guys come into my office, \"Sir, I\\'m the greatest salesman. Nobody can sell…\" You know, the truth is anybody that says they\\'re a great salesman, usually they\\'re not a very good salesman. It\\'s true. It\\'s those sneaky ones in the back that don\\'t talk, that you don\\'t know about. They\\'re the ones. But Beto was nasty, and he said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven. He came down. And if that\\'s the case, some really bad things happen, because he made a total fool out of himself. And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas. He came out of Texas, a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be. So he was a nasty guy, but he had a couple of policies that don\\'t work well in the state of Texas. Right? He was against religion. He was against you having a gun. And he was against oil. So you come from Texas, you don\\'t like religion, you don\\'t like oil, and you don\\'t have guns. I don\\'t know. That\\'s not a good combination in the state of Texas. That\\'s not good in Mississippi, either. I don\\'t know it\\'s that good anywhere. Nah, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully we won\\'t be hearing about him for a long time. It\\'s amazing how cold you could get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy. But in the twist… Oh, Alabama. Love Alabama. I love Alabama. I love Alabama. It\\'s a great place. But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush and that means Clinton and that means Obama, they have me supposedly saying to myself, \"Well, let\\'s see. I got a guy named Sleepy Joe Biden. How do I beat him? How do I beat him? How do I beat this guy? He\\'s such a great.\" Clinton, she was easy. Right? Obama was easy. The Bush dynasty was. But sleepy Joe, I\\'m worried about, right? So then I said to myself, \"Gee, I guess there\\'s only one way. Let\\'s call up Ukraine for help. These people are sick. These people are sick. Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and they\\'ll put it, because they\\'re so damn dishonest, and they\\'ll just say- … \"Let\\'s use Ukraine for help.\" That\\'s what they\\'re going to say. And they won\\'t show the laughter, and they won\\'t show the sarcasm, and they won\\'t show the fun because they\\'re the most dishonorable people almost on earth. It\\'s a disgrace. But we say it anyway. And here\\'s the good news. The people get it. So they have a brand new president in Ukraine. Good guy, by the way. And I call a brand new person, a man I have no idea who he is, and I\\'m on a phone, right? And I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country, many people listen. And I\\'m on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new president, just got there, called to congratulate him, \"Please, could you help me please?\" I don\\'t know who he is. I didn\\'t know his name until I looked down the card, I see. And he\\'s a nice guy, and hopefully he\\'s going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems. And one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption. But the other reason… Why isn\\'t Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there… Why aren\\'t they doing things that they\\'re supposed to do? Why is it always the United States? So I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect. It was perfect. It wasn\\'t like almost… It was perfect. It was totally appropriate. I made it at the behest of people to say, \"Could you call and say hello?\" Now I\\'m an honest person, anyway. But do you think, when I\\'m making a call to a newly-elected president of a country, that I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening on the line? Many people. Whoever the hell wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people. And remember, the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America, the president. I guarantee he\\'s got a lot of people listening, too. These people are sick.  no pressure. They must think we\\'re nuts, to be honest. It\\'s all a phony deal, this whole impeachment scam, to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections, maybe the greatest … I mean, let\\'s give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we\\'ve ever had. So my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don\\'t quit. But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of Sleepy Joe. So I quote, \"I said\" … Let me act like him. I\\'ve got to speak really slow though, and … \"I said, ‘You\\'re not getting a billion.\\' I looked at them and I said, ‘I\\'m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor isn\\'t fired, you\\'re not getting the money. You understand? You\\'re not getting the money.\\'\" Then he goes, at the end … I didn\\'t know he had this kind of energy. He goes, \"Well, son of a bitch, he got fired.\" You know, in a certain way, I was impressed because, I mean, I didn\\'t think he had the energy, the brain power. It\\'s turned out he doesn\\'t. By the way, he\\'s dropping like a rock. When you\\'re at 1%, there\\'s always a reason. He should be there fairly soon. As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold, I think it was $1 billion or something in aid, was the prosecutor investigating his son\\'s company, that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy just got thrown out of the Navy … He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy. He knew less about it than this young … How old are you? Six. This young, beautiful person in front of me. Six. And this young six-year-old is smarter, so I think I\\'d basically go with her. So what is it all about? It\\'s called a payoff, but you know what? The fake news, they apologize. I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper. Well, the hatred, I mean, between him and Fredo. You\\'ve got Fredo and … That\\'s Cuomo, Fredo. I call him Fredo, like from the movie. Now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden. The good news is Biden didn\\'t know too much about what the hell he was talking about. Remember Biden said, \"I don\\'t know these people. I don\\'t know them. I don\\'t know them.\"  we\\'re dealing with life, right? He never spoke to him. Unfortunately, the next day … In the world of the internet, in the world of smart people … That\\'s why I like Beto, he wasn\\'t smart, couldn\\'t handle it. I told my wife, I said, \"See, it\\'s not so easy.\" I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love. They love her. When Beto quit, he quit like a dog. When he quit I said, \"See, people think this is easy. This isn\\'t easy,\" but it just worked out that way. But Biden said, \"I never met the people, never met the gentlemen.\" Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they\\'re playing golf together, but he never met him. So now you\\'ll ask him, he\\'ll say, \"No, we played around a golf. We were together for three hours. I never mentioned the fact that they\\'re paying my son millions.\" Oh, no, no, no. … Well, they might be watching us. I guess they do watch us. He used to interview me. He was so nice. Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me. It was like they were love fests, but I don\\'t want anything to do with him. They were love fests. What a thought. He\\'s weak. He\\'s a weak person, but they\\'re all weak. But let me just tell you something. We need honesty with our media. We need honesty, because the New York Times, the Washington Post … And by the way, I don\\'t know, you probably read it. We threw them out at the White House. We don\\'t show them anymore. If somebody wants to go and buy them; we threw them out. And they came into my office and then I got to get back to this guy. Where\\'s Hunter? Where\\'s Hunter? We had a tee shirt made, \"Where\\'s Hunter? Where\\'s Hunter?\" Poor Hunter. He then came out, he did the Morning Show. That was the last we\\'ve seen of Hunter. That wasn\\'t good. The morning of his father\\'s very bad debate, but it\\'s, where is Hunter? But before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while, we got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times. We got rid of them, right? We don\\'t have them in the White House. I said, \"No, you could … People can go out and buy them, but we don\\'t\" … We used to have them stacked up, and I\\'d go in and I\\'d see a meeting with my people and they\\'re dealing with China, South Korea, or somebody. And I\\'d go into these offices; I\\'d see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. I keep trying to figure out who\\'s worse. And one day it\\'s the Times, one day it\\'s the Post. It\\'s like top each other, they\\'re so bad. It\\'s so phony. In my opinion, it\\'s virtually corrupt. I\\'ve never seen it. You never have a good story. I mean, even when we got al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric. Where did that come from? The other thing, if Obama would have done it … because, look. This guy built ISIS. The caliphate, it was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio. That\\'s a big, lot of land. 7 million people, and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits. I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were … How can you be happy? But they were so thrilled that we got this animal. They were so thrilled. But you know what? And you know what? We don\\'t do it for … We do it because it\\'s right. That story was a massive story. That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest, ever. Bigger than anything. That story disappeared so fast. Done. And that\\'s okay. I didn\\'t do it for the story. I did it because it\\'s the right thing to do. But if I were a Democrat, they\\'d be talking about that story for weeks. With me, they don\\'t even want to … They actually played it down. And actually, and I\\'m happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me. And I\\'m very happy with that. I\\'m very … Conan is incredible. And Conan\\'s coming to the White House in a few weeks. But it is true. Did you ever see a story disappear so fast? I mean, if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months. They\\'d be talking about his bravery. Oh, so bravery. But again, 142 judges he gave us. Remember that. How can you be a great … They always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges. We got two Supreme Courts. Great ones. Great judge. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges. By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-Justice Kavanaugh? Did anybody ever? Was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with? Anyway, just to finish. So Hunter then goes to China. Now I\\'m dealing with China right now. They don\\'t like me too much. They dream about the day when somebody else … And would they like to have … How about this? You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, too, you give him $1.5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street can\\'t get it. He walks out with $1.5 billion. And then there are other places also, I understand. Folks, it\\'s disgraceful that the press doesn\\'t cover it for what it is. It\\'s a payoff. It\\'s a payoff. And how would you like to have Sleepy Joe, with the son getting all of this money from China, become president and take over the China deal? They are not liking me. They had the worst year that they\\'ve had in 57 years. Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars. We\\'re taking billions and billions of dollars, and you know what we\\'re doing with some of it? Just a small portion, but 100%, they\\'re taking care of … Our farmers got $16 billion last year and $12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers, because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers. So they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing. And they thought our farmers would say, \"Oh, we don\\'t like Trump.\" They did just the opposite. They said, \"We know he\\'s doing the right thing because we\\'ve been ripped off for so many years.\" But I said to him, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Purdue, a great guy; I said, \"Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product?\" He said, \"Sir, $16 billion.\" I said, \"Good, I\\'ll make it up.\" And we\\'re going to have a lot leftover. So we will have, pretty soon, over $100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents. They only took. They only took. So when I said to the farmers, \"We\\'re going to send you $16 billion, and it\\'s already been sent. And it\\'s been split into $12 billion the year before.\" I mean, think of that, $28 billion. I said, \"Compliments of China.\" And we had a lot left over. Not bad, right? Not bad. You think Obama would do that? I don\\'t think so. You think Hillary would do that? I don\\'t think so. You think Sleepy Joe would do that? I don\\'t think so. He wouldn\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message. It\\'s very important for this reason, as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst. But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption. They\\'re corrupt. Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician. You know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it, I said, \"Oh, I\\'m going to sue him.\" They said, \"Sir, I\\'m sorry. You can\\'t.\" He\\'s got total immunity because he made it in Congress. Can you believe this? But here\\'s the good news. At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what\\'s going on. A bunch of phony people, but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great, new Republican … Right? Republican governor, right? Hey, he\\'s a great guy, too. And all I know is he\\'s loved and respected by your current governor, because Phil is some piece of work. Phil is so confident. I wanted Phil to run for a certain office, then I wanted him to do something. I\\'ve tried to get him, but some guys are confident. Phil said, \"No sir, I\\'ve been doing this all my life. I love the people.\" He built the most beautiful African-American museum. Phil, he\\'s the greatest, but he built the most beautiful … But he\\'s got confidence. And he said, \"No sir, I\\'d been doing it. I don\\'t really want to do that.\" In other words, he said, \"That\\'s enough.\" … Oh, we love our police, right? I love our police. We love our police. He\\'ll oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible. They\\'re terrible. And Tate will always defend your Second Amendment. So Tate\\'s running against a liberal Democrat named Jim Hood. Now all I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama. Isn\\'t that nice? He wanted Obama to win so badly and then he wanted Hillary to win. And that\\'s not the kind of guy we need here. Not in Mississippi. He\\'s supported by extreme leftists like Stacey Abrams, who, by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp. And they came in with … Oh, they brought them all. They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey. They came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won. We won, fairly easily. But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote. Do you believe this? I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education. They want to give them this. They want to give them free healthcare. They want to give these people, that come into our country illegally all benefits, and he opposed our travel ban, which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country. And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense. If you don\\'t want a far left Democrat running Mississippi … Wait a minute. How\\'s this guy? I can\\'t believe this is a competitive race. It\\'s embarrassing. I\\'m talking to Mississippi. I\\'m talking to Mississippi. I can\\'t believe it. I don\\'t think that he\\'s going to be the right guy. I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves. He\\'s going to be fantastic. He will be a great, great governor. Tate, come on up. Tate. Thank you, Tate. Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate. He\\'ll never let you down. And don\\'t kid yourself. Your Second Amendment is under attack, but not with him. It\\'s under attack. So we\\'re also joined tonight by a man who is truly, and I\\'ve sort of said it a lot, but he\\'s been a great governor and he loves your state. He loves the people of this great state, Governor Phil Bryant. Where\\'s Phil? Come up, Phil. Come up. Oh, he\\'s central casting. Look at him. Come here, Phil. Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Thank you, my Phil. What a job. What a great job. You have to continue that whole thing going forward. So another man who\\'s a warrior is a friend of mine. Whenever there\\'s a problem, he\\'s there. He\\'s always there. He\\'ll be right at the front. He is tough. He is smart. He\\'s brilliant, actually. And he loves this state and he loves you people. Senator Roger Wicker. Roger. Thanks, Roger. Thank you, Roger. And somebody, I\\'ll call her up because, believe it or not, she\\'s running with me. She just ran. I said, \"Cindy, you just ran. You just won.\" She said, \"No, I have to do it again.\" She\\'s running in 2020. I thought she\\'d have six years. I said, \"Cindy, it\\'s only like a year.\" Cindy Hyde-Smith. She\\'s incredible. She\\'s tough and smart and strong, and she\\'s with us all the way. Cindy Hyde-Smith.  Trent Kelly, Michael Guest. Incredible people. And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann. Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch. Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson. Great people. Your next State Treasure, David McRae. State Auditor, Shad White. Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gipson. Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney. And former governor, a man that nobody\\'s ever heard of in this room, I\\'m sure, but the truth is he\\'s a legend in politics and a great guy. He\\'s a great guy, Haley Barbour. … Hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country. Under my administration, we\\'ve already added nearly 10,000 new factories, and many more are coming in as we speak. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average $2,000 to $2,500 per family, bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores. What\\'s happening? You couldn\\'t get the money. The big companies, they couldn\\'t get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint. They brought back almost $1 trillion now because of us. All put to work. We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy. We are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world. For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals. Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization. Two of the worst deals ever made by our country. 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that, and that\\'s awful, and a big price to pay for Washington\\'s disloyalty to the American worker. That\\'s what it was. It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons. But now you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am. I\\'m a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity. We\\'re stopping China from ripping us off. We\\'re stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories. That\\'s not happening anymore. It\\'s reversed. We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore, and they all know it. We\\'re replacing NAFTA … and that was a disaster, NAFTA … with the brand new US, Mexico, Canada agreement if Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable. Nervous Nancy, she doesn\\'t want to give the people of our country a victory. She\\'s very busy doing other things. Having fun. The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi\\'s farmers and also includes powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else. It\\'s a great agreement. About time we got rid of NAFTA. The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now. The last administration\\'s horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the US auto industry, but I proudly, first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity. Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a $170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility … did you ever hear of this place … Blue Springs. Blue Springs. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world. We take care of other people. We take care of other countries, but we don\\'t take care of our own. They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. They deployed our military to protect … think of this … immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. I ask those wealthy nations now, I respectfully the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, \"King, we\\'re going to help you, but you\\'ve got to pay.\" And he was great. No, he was great. He was great. He said, \"But nobody has ever asked before.\" I said, \"But I\\'m asking.\" And billions of dollars will come in, and we\\'re protecting a great ally. We have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things. But we said, \"You\\'re very wealthy. You have to pay,\" and they\\'re going to pay. And that\\'s true with many countries by the way. That\\'s true with many countries. They never respected us. They could never believe it. I said to one country … I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan. I said to Prime Minister, I said, \"How did you get away with this for so long?\" And he looked at me and he couldn\\'t really answer it because how the hell did this happen? We\\'re protecting 94 countries. Ask China, \"How many countries are you protecting President Xi?\" And they look at me like, \"What a stupid question. We protect one. China.\" You ask President Putin, \"How many countries are you protecting President Putin?\" And he looks and he goes, \"Russia.\" You ask other countries … we\\'re protecting at least 94. In fact, so many they can\\'t even tell me. I\\'ve been trying to get an answer for four months. So many they can\\'t even tell. It\\'s crazy, but it\\'s all beautiful the way it\\'s happening. A lot of good things are happening. But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay. Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you, to take your money, to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth all over the globe, wherever they wanted it. But I don\\'t like that. I don\\'t like that. The great sellout has ended, and it ended the day I took the oath of office. That was quite a day. After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation. We are finally putting America first. Our policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests. It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policemen of the world. Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood. Not one drop. Actually, I have to be honest. One soldier stepped on a nail. That\\'s true. I said, \"Don\\'t tell the press that because they\\'ll say, but one soldier stepped in a nail.\" I said, \"How bad was it?\" \"It\\'s okay.\" I said, \"Don\\'t mention it please.\" They always like to mention exactly what happened. You can take it a little bit low key. Stepped on a nail. Not a drop of blood. And we don\\'t have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria. They\\'ve been fighting for 1000 years. But what we do is we did keep the oil, if you don\\'t mind. We kept the oil. We kept the oil. And we\\'ll distribute that oil, we\\'ll help out the Kurds, and we\\'ll help out other people. We\\'ll also help out ourselves if that\\'s okay. Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very, very dangerous war zones. Then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions. I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think so. We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here. We don\\'t want to do that. To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures. Toughest ever that we\\'ve ever had. No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats. They want open borders, which mean crime. They want sanctuary cities, which means crime and drugs and death. After bleeding the middle class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels. Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities. We are now building a wall. We\\'re building it. We\\'re building it. And you think that was easy? The Democrats, they didn\\'t want that wall. I got money for everything, but when it came to the wall, not 25 cents. Not 25 cents. But we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here, we took it from there. Or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases. We\\'re winning cases now. Winning a lot of cases. But the wall is going up rapidly. It\\'s going up rapidly. And this is a very serious wall. This is the exact everything they wanted. I went to the border patrol, incredible people and ICE. Incredible people, tough people. They love our country. And I said, \"Give me the specifications for the wall.\" They said, \"Well sir, we\\'d like steel, but would also like concrete and would also like rebar.\" I said, \"Well, what do you want? Which one?\" So I did all three because it\\'s a different form of cutting. You can cut through steel, but you can\\'t through the concrete and then you can\\'t through the hardened rebar. We got it all. \"And we also need see-through, sir. Got to see who\\'s on the other side.\" That makes sense, right? Not just concrete. It\\'s more expensive what we\\'re doing, but we\\'re giving and we\\'re building … we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It\\'s going up fast. In all the right areas. In all the right areas. That was a tough one. And the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out. They\\'re great. Great people. We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country. And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern Border, tough place, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May, and we are faster than ever securing the Southern Border. And soon it will be, when the wall is completed, secure like it\\'s never been before. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders. 27,000. You know what that is? And they are keeping people out. And I want to thank the President of Mexico. He\\'s an excellent person, great man. And we appreciate it. And the reason is that our Democrats won\\'t even approve things called loopholes. They\\'re loopholes. That\\'s a horrible name, right? That means it\\'s a loophole. That means you can come in illegally and lots of things. Catch and release. You catch them. Then you\\'ve got to release them. By law you\\'ve got to release them or they\\'ll arrest the border patrol agent if they don\\'t release. It\\'s crazy. But we could end this in 15 minutes, but they don\\'t want to do it. They don\\'t want to do it. They\\'re obstructionists. They\\'re colluders. And we can\\'t let it happen. That\\'s why you have to go with Tate Reeves. Tate\\'s going to send a big signal, by the way. It\\'s a big signal. It\\'s great for you. He\\'s going to be a great governor. It also sends a big signal to these radical left, crazy Democrats. It\\'s very important that Tate wins. Very important. We\\'re also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said, \"We\\'re not going to have them,\" and Roger Wicker said, \"We\\'re not going to have them. And Cindy said, \"We\\'re not going to have them.\" Democrats\\' sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE … and they are heroes, I wouldn\\'t want their job. MS-13, they walk right into those nests … they call them a nest … and they start swinging. You never saw anything like it. I\\'ll say, \"You know what? Better you than me.\" Let\\'s see who would do good. He\\'d do good. That guy. That guy would do good. Most of you wouldn\\'t do too good. No. I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country. Who would do it? They\\'re moving thousands of people from MS-13. These gangs are the worst people. These people, these are not human beings. You know, I said that once before and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said, \"How dare you say they\\'re not human?\" You ever see these people? And they slice people up with a knife because it\\'s more painful than using a gun. And then I have to defend myself when I say they\\'re animals. But you know what? I never changed. I didn\\'t say, \"Oh, I\\'d like to apologize. I\\'d like to apologize. Crazy Nancy.\" And you got to look at her district in San Francisco. She\\'s spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff. Take a look at what\\'s happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco. It\\'s thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods. Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy. Go home and fix your district. Go home and fix your district. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and border patrol, vote for Tate Reeves. Tuesday. Got to get out. You got to get out. Got to send the signal. Let it be a big victory too. The Democrat party has never been more extreme, you know that, than it is today. The Democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate Medicare. I will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. We\\'ll always take care of them. Virtually every Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth. Well, the governor of Virginia executed a baby. Remember that whole thing. After birth, after birth. Some people never heard of it. He said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother. Nobody ever heard that. That is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream. Nobody has done more for the African American community than the Republican party. And we\\'re also the party of Abraham Lincoln. We can\\'t forget that. People forget. Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe. To lift up distressed communities, we created opportunities zones. So incredible. So successful. Including 100 new opportunity zones right now in Mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix. And Tim Scott, I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina choices. They can go out, get a doctor, we pay the bill, and they don\\'t have to wait six weeks, four weeks, two weeks. We had people waiting in line. They weren\\'t very sick. By the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. Now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans. The great rebuilding of the American Armed Forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville. And Roger has been fantastic. And Cindy Hyde-Smith has been fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To protect America\\'s security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It\\'s not the same country anymore. Nothing\\'s easy, but it\\'s not the same. And I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. For years you watch as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi. The next step to victory begins on Tuesday right here in your great state. With your support we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history. And you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high, it\\'s … I will tell you something … if we didn\\'t win this election, that stock market would be in one-half. It was heading in the wrong direction. It was going to fail. And if they ever did anything bad, if they ever do anything bad to us, if they ever succeed in their wildest dream, which will never let them happen, that stock market will crash like you\\'ve never seen a crash before. And you will not be happy with your 401ks like you\\'re happy right now because they don\\'t know what they\\'re doing. They don\\'t know what they\\'re doing. And I\\'d like to speak well, but the leadership, they have no clue. They\\'re just very vicious people. Actually, they\\'re sort of mentally violent people, but we\\'ve got it under control. It always helps when you didn\\'t do anything wrong. I always say, \"How do you impeach a President who didn\\'t do anything wrong?\" So we\\'re going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson. On Tuesday, you\\'re going to get out and you\\'re going to vote, and you\\'re going to give up whatever you have to give up. You\\'re going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late. Tell your boss I said it was okay. I will give you a pardon if I have to. I\\'ll give you a one-hour pardon. But with your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. And you have great congressmen here and I\\'ll tell you, I want to appreciate it, fellas. Warriors, you\\'re warriors. You are warriors. What was it? 196 for and nothing against, right? That doesn\\'t happen with Republicans. It doesn\\'t happen. I always complain. I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians. They have lousy policies. Open borders, sanctuary cities, but they have one thing. They stick together and they\\'re vicious. The Republicans have great policy. In many ways they\\'re better politicians, but they\\'re not as vicious. Thank you, darling. I appreciate it. They\\'re not as vicious, but they have a tendency to split apart. The Democrats don\\'t seem to have any Mitt Romneys. We do. We do. I don\\'t know. Maybe he\\'ll get better. Maybe he\\'ll get better. We\\'ll see. We\\'ll see what happens. Maybe he\\'ll get better. Just let it be fair, but they don\\'t have that. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, ‘Made in the USA.\\' Made in America. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Can you believe that? Within 10 years it will be over. When they told me that, I said, \"That\\'s incredible.\" We\\'re going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years. It\\'s funded. Nobody would have thought we could do that, but we\\'re doing it. We\\'ll have it ended in America in 10 years. The AIDS epidemic. Who would\\'ve thought? We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and we always will. You\\'ll never see it disappear. In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, pioneered technology, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And today it\\'s greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. That\\'s what we\\'re doing. That\\'s what happened in 2016. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We\\'ll get so tired of winning. I don\\'t know, Mississippi. You\\'re winning. You had the best year you\\'ve ever had. You have the best, Mississippi, the best year you\\'ve ever had in the history of our country. Mississippi. Your statistic. Mississippi, aren\\'t you getting tired of winning? I guess not. So Phil doesn\\'t come to me and say, \"Sir, please, we\\'re willing too much. The people of Mississippi can\\'t take it anymore.\" I don\\'t think you\\'ll ever have to make that trip. I don\\'t think he\\'s ever going to have to, and I don\\'t think Tate will ever have to make that trip. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Mississippi. Thank you.\\nI want to thank you very much. North Carolina, thank you very much. I\\'m thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte, where, by the way, we\\'re having our convention. I guess you heard that, right? With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now, we\\'re going to defeat the radical socialists. We\\'re going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide. We won it last time, we\\'re going to win it this time by even more. And you know, Eric and Lara named their daughter, you know what her name is? Carolina, Carolina. Her name is Carolina for a reason. This is an incredible time for our nation. Our country is stronger than ever before. And today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. That\\'s great. That\\'s great. That was great. You know, our opponents were saying, \" Oh, maybe he\\'s in trouble, maybe the economy … \" They\\'ll do anything. They\\'ll do anything. I\\'m sure they were thrilled. Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today? I don\\'t think so. By the way, look at this. Look back there, look at all of that press. Look at all them. Man, I don\\'t know if Sleepy Joe, or Bernie, I don\\'t think they have that much press. Bernie was going wild. Why would I be here tonight? Why would I be here? He said why would I be here tonight? We don\\'t have the primary, we\\'ve already won the thing, you know? I was going to say the you know what thing, I held it back, because they\\'ll say, \"Horrible language. He used horrible language today.\" But we\\'re doing fantastically. There\\'s never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now. Never, never. And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie, and that\\'s true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too. And there\\'s not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he\\'s running for the Senate. I looked at the First Lady, I said, \" Hey, he\\'s running for the Senate.\" And today he just said Super Thursday, he\\'s looking forward to Super Thursday. Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military. Every day, for me and for you, it\\'s promises made, promises kept. One of the most important promises I made is right to this era. You know, we look at it, it\\'s the never ending wars in the Middle East. We\\'re taking our soldiers, we\\'re bringing them back home. We\\'re not law enforcement. We\\'re bringing them back home. American troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don\\'t want it. The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country. Two days ago, the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens And all of the things that we\\'ve done, we\\'ve wiped out the terrorists, we\\'ve done so much, and you know what? We\\'re 8,000 miles away. You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan, you\\'ve got Afghanistan itself. The progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. You know that. We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice. As we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place. They\\'re not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them. We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. By the way, I have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas, any one of them, Sleepy Joe, he doesn\\'t have that, so he doesn\\'t have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd. They never say that. Hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. Right now. Spin them around. No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally, but do we have a great time at a Trump rally? My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus. You know about this whole thing? Horrible. Including, sweeping travel restrictions. Today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and they\\'re really working hard, and they\\'re working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. They\\'re going to have vaccines I think relatively soon. And they\\'re going to have something that makes you better, and that\\'s going to actually take place we think even sooner. So a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. We went out, we\\'re doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. We\\'re working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world? I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. And we\\'re working with other countries. In all fairness, look, it\\'s a problem, we\\'re working with other countries. Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right? From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. Think of it, 27,000. You lose 27,000 people to the common flu. It can be much more. One year was much higher than the 70,000 number. Those people died. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn\\'t know that. Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, \"What do we lose with the regular flu?\" They said, \"About 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people.\" I said, \"Nobody told me that. Nobody knows that.\" Last year was approximately 36,000 people died. So we\\'re working hard on it, and we\\'re going to come up with some really great solutions. In the meantime, we\\'re stopping … Only in North Carolina. Only in North Carolina. It can only be. How many people here are from South Carolina, by the way? All right, we love both places. But that was from North Carolina. But just to finish up, so we\\'ve made a lot of progress, we\\'ve really done a great job with it. We\\'re keeping our borders strong. My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that\\'s what I\\'ll do. Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. But honestly, not so much anymore. Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. We\\'re actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. So we have our professionals in constant touch, I\\'m in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop. We\\'ve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. We\\'re going to safeguard our people, the United States. The United States is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness. Earlier today, when I met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly. The media didn\\'t know. Nobody knew. They\\'ve never heard this before. And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. Who knows what happened, but we\\'re going to reduce and the severity of what\\'s happening, the duration of the virus. We discussed all of these things. We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible. And I have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, America is so resilient, we know what we\\'re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth. We have the greatest health system on earth. The renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion. No country is better equipped than America to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than Americans. And together, we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That\\'s what it is. Last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in January alone. That makes seven million jobs since the election. We have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He is dead. And we took out the world\\'s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, Soleimani. While the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up American citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday. No, he said, \"Super Thursday.\" You can\\'t do these things. Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday? It would be over, right? I would be over. No matter how good you are at certain things, you can\\'t, as an example, a name like Sleepy Joe, he\\'s constantly naming the wrong state. \"It\\'s great to be in the state of Ohio.\" No, no, no, I\\'m sorry, you\\'re in North Carolina. No, no. Joe! Do you ever see them run up with a sign, \"No, no, North Carolina, Joe!\" Once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because it\\'s a disaster no matter how good you\\'re doing. We\\'re in North Carolina! It\\'s great to be in Idaho! No, you\\'re in Iowa. Nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, they\\'re a little scary? We\\'re going to protect your second amendment, you understand that. But did you see, Sleepy Joe, did you see Sleepy Joe, where he said, \"Last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country.\" 150 million! That means 50% of our country. That\\'s a big story. 150. Can you imagine Trump saying that? These people would never let me live it down. We can\\'t make even a little mistake. We can\\'t make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake. If we make a tiny mistake, it\\'s headlining. They say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say Super Thursday, they say Georgia, he\\'s looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow. Georgia\\'s not in Super Tuesday! So many mistakes! You can\\'t do that when you\\'re negotiating with China. Can\\'t do that when you\\'re negotiating with these countries, can you? Those mistakes would be very tremendous. Then you have Mini Mike. You see this guy? Can you believe it? Mini Mike. He\\'s being interviewed tonight on Fox. Can you believe it? Fox. They want to be politically correct. They want to interview, they end up interviewing more Democrats than Republic … I don\\'t know what\\'s going on with Fox. But they\\'re interviewing this guy the night before … Mini Mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is. The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history. The worst in history. Nah, I got to have more. I\\'d get down real low, but I don\\'t want to copy him. Everybody saw it. Everyone said, \"Oh,\" they all say, \"Oh! Do that again where you get down low.\" But if I do that again, it\\'s a copy. It\\'s a copy! No, no. No. You never like to copy, even though you\\'re copying yourself. You don\\'t like to copy. You do it once. It was a big hit. But you do it once, and you sort of say, \"That was nice, don\\'t do it again,\" because if it doesn\\'t work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right? Right? We all know. But no, he\\'s a disaster waiting to happen. He\\'s a mess. No matter which Democrat candidate you\\'re talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates … And you see what\\'s happening, right? It\\'s being rigged against … It\\'s sad. It\\'s being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy. Crazy. I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they\\'re doing. I called it a long time ago. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Buttigieg, May Pete, he quit. Out last night. Then I hear a Senator from a state we\\'re going to win, we\\'re going to win that state, but she dropped out. Sounds like they made a deal. They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo, that\\'s why. Don\\'t care. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo, they made a deal. Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo. But they\\'ve embraced an extreme left wing agenda. Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty. You know that. The Democrat Party has gone crazy. Whether it\\'s Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Pocahontas\\'s plan … By the way, she\\'s history. She\\'s history. I came up with that name far too early, I should\\'ve just waited. But it didn\\'t matter. I thought she was making a come back. I said, \"Wow, I just did it to her.\" But you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago? They never caught on. In fact, she\\'ll probably lose the State of Massachusetts to Bernie. So she doesn\\'t know what to do because you\\'re not supposed to lose the State of Massachusetts if you get in there. She\\'s the Senator. She\\'s the Senator for Massachusetts, I think she\\'s going to lose it to Bernie. And Miss Michigan, you see what\\'s going on over there? Michigan, we\\'re leading. We\\'re leading in Wisconsin. We\\'re leading in Florida. We\\'re leading in the last election. Hey, how great was the 2016 election? One of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television. And remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one. This is going to be… oh, that wasn\\'t so easy for them. I love the scene. The scene of that convention center where Hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost. But Elizabeth Warren\\'s here to plan to eliminate our borders, or Mini Mike\\'s plan to eliminate your second amendment. Mike Bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment. Don\\'t worry about it, it\\'s not going to happen. Not going to happen for him. For sleepy Joe, he doesn\\'t even know where he is, what he\\'s doing, or what office he\\'s running for. Actually, I honestly don\\'t think he knows what office he\\'s running for. And it doesn\\'t matter. Maybe he gets in, because he\\'s a little more moderate. So maybe he gets in. But he\\'s not going to be running it. Other people are going to. They\\'re going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. But they\\'re going to be super left radical crazies. They\\'re going to be super left radical crazies, Joe\\'s going to be in a home. He\\'ll be watching television. Everything will be just fine. The insanity of Washington Democrats is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican party. We have the enthusiasm in our party. No, I really mean it. I constantly hear about the enthusiasm. They\\'re fighting each other, they hate each other, they don\\'t know what\\'s going on. We have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what we\\'re doing. We know what we\\'re doing. So we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors. Even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, he\\'s become a great friend of mine. What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that? One of the greatest statements ever made in the United State\\'s Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham. Come on up, Lindsey. Lindsey Graham, come on up, Lindsey. Come here, Lindsey. I got to have him say something, come here, Lindsey, great guy. They handle pressure so well. They came and we gave a rally that was like this and Dan Bishop and Gregg Murphy won by so much, it wasn\\'t even close. They\\'re great people, and they\\'ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. They handle pressure. They were under a lot of pressure, they handled it well. It\\'s nice to know people can handle pressure, there aren\\'t too many of them. North Carolina Republican party chairman Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. I have a few great friends of mine and they love North Carolina. Louis DeJoy, who you know, Louis DeJoy. Two great people, diamond and silk. Right? Diamond and silk. We love them. You know the first lady, a long time ago now, right? How long is that? Probably almost almost five years ago, she said, \"There are these two women on the internet, they\\'re unbelievable. They\\'re unbelievable.\" I said, \"Oh, I know, I hear that all the time. I hear it all the time.\" She said, the next day she came again. She said, \"I saw them again, they\\'re unbelievable.\" I said, \"Let me see.\" I saw them, I fell in love with it, and everybody fell in love with Diamond and Silk. So thank you. Some people that have really been helpful to me, Corey Lewandowski, David Bussey, and Pam Bondi, right here. Thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 Republican National Convention right here in Charlotte an outstanding success, RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co chairman Tommy Hicks, and Convention president Marcia Lee Kelly, thank you all. You\\'re doing a great job, I\\'ll tell you they\\'re looking, they\\'re going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job. Should we doing a great job, but just an okay job? It doesn\\'t matter as long as you win. You know what I gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom. I said, \"What the heck, if I win, nobody cares, if I don\\'t.\" Look if you win, nobody cares what room you\\'re in. If you lose, nobody cares what room you\\'re in. So we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, that\\'s it, no big deal. I think it this way, if we win, nobody cares. And if we lose, I\\'m out of there, I save a hell of a lot of money. Every place that we\\'ve gone, it\\'s been amazing. I\\'d also like to recognize, so important, a woman who\\'s really helped us win North Carolina in 2016, I have a feeling this year, she\\'ll even do better, because she happened to grow up here, Lara Trump and my son Eric Trump. Two great people. I mean I have to say that about my son, but I know a lot of people don\\'t like their sons that much, but Lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job. She knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here. How are we doing, Lara? How are we doing? How are we doing in the state, are we doing good? And we\\'re doing well in Pennsylvania I hear, and South Carolina, I know we\\'re doing great there. Also with us tonight, is a man who\\'s really become a good friend of mine. We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didn\\'t get along, I would not be here. I wouldn\\'t do this. I think he\\'s been tremendous. He\\'s been a tremendous supporter and things that we\\'ve wanted to do, and fights that we\\'ve had which were so important, he\\'s been right up, and Lizzie will tell you that he\\'s been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term. Probably a lot longer than that, but he\\'s going to come up and I\\'m going to ask Senator Thom Tillis, come on up. Thom has really been incredible, he\\'s been working everyday. And he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration. Thom is the champion for the people of North Carolina. This November, we need everybody to go and vote for Thom, he\\'s doing great. He\\'s doing great. I hear he\\'s way up in the polls, he\\'s way up in the polls. Thom, say a few words. \"Get me off this stage. Get me off. You guys didn\\'t tell me this was going to happen.\" No, that was great Thom. We\\'re also honored to be joined tonight by a true American hero, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old. His name is George Washington Perry, legit. George, thank you very much for being here. Thank you, George. 100 years. He\\'s 100 and he looks good. Thank you, George. With the help of everyone here tonight, America has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth. Since my election over 219,000 new jobs have been created right here in North Carolina. We have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps. Median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history, that\\'s happening, that\\'s happening. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history. Very important to me, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. For decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed African Americans. My administration is delivering for African Americans like never before. No president has done more for our black community, no president has done more for our black community, and it\\'s an honor to do it. Last month here in Charlotte, we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all Americans. It\\'s called Opportunity Now, you know about it. We\\'re also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave, reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40,000,000 american families an average of $2,200 thanks to the Republican child tax credit. The Republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did, but the Democrats are saying, \"How did they do that one?\". The USMCA is a giant for North Carolina\\'s incredible farmers and factory workers. And by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax. You know about the death tax, right? It\\'s called the inheritance tax. You have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax. So if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, there\\'s no tax to be paid by your children. So they don\\'t have to go back to the evil banker, borrow money from the banker, lose the farm, lose the business, it won\\'t happen. And I always say, I know a lot of parents that don\\'t love the children very much. Is there anybody in this room that does not love your children? Please raise your hand. Please raise your hand. Nobody. Nobody, that\\'s because we\\'re North Carolina, you love your children. But if you don\\'t, then it doesn\\'t matter because if you don\\'t love your children, don\\'t leave them a damn thing, but you don\\'t have the inheritance tax anymore, which is great. A lot of people don\\'t even know that, but that\\'s a big deal or no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betraying the American people than on the issue of immigration sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities. Right here in North Carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it. Killing her and dumping her body into the woods. Last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina, how did that happen to North Carolina? Deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of, and these are really dangerous criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of burglary, gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even suffering they inflict on our people. We\\'re building the wall. We\\'re building the wall. We\\'re building the wall. We\\'re building the wall. Mexico\\'s paying for the wall, by the way. We built 127 miles as of today, 127. Mexico is paying for the wall. The media is going to be thrilled when I explain that Mexico is paying for the wall because you know, now finally they said I\\'ve had obstruction like you wouldn\\'t believe. The entire democratic party. I could get anything. I created Space Force. I could do anything. I could get. Lindsey and Thom Tillis knows. Mark knows this. All of them knows this. If I wanted 25 cents for the wall, they didn\\'t want to get it. They didn\\'t want to do it, but now we got it, and you think that\\'s easy? Nobody else could have done this. We\\'re building it. We\\'re building our hearts away. We\\'ll soon be building many, many miles a week, but we\\'re up to over 125, I guess 127, 28 by now, of the super duper wall, super duper. I went to Border Patrol, I said, \" What is your wish?\" \"Well, sir, we\\'d like it to be steel and concrete.\" They want it exactly what they have it, and the barriers up top, they want everything. It\\'s called a no climb provisor, no climb provisor. I said, \"What does the word provisor mean?\" They didn\\'t know. All it means is you\\'re not able to climb over it. It is very tough. I don\\'t know if you saw. In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down. That\\'s what the no climb is. That\\'s what the no climb is. It\\'s a no climb. It\\'s more money. It\\'s a little more expensive. Thank you. Who is that? What a voice. Pavarotti. So, we\\'re building the wall. It\\'s going great. So, they said, \"All right. He\\'s building the wall, but Mexico\\'s not paying for it.\" Yes, they are. You\\'ll see. You\\'ll see. You understand. Some of you understand because I told a few people last week, it got linked to the fake news media. If you want to end sanctuary cities in North Carolina and across America, then you have only one choice. You must vote Republican. You have to. You have to. We\\'ve added catch and release, one of the worst loopholes you\\'ve ever seen, catch and release. You catch them. You then say, \"Where do you live?\" They don\\'t know because look, let\\'s face it, they don\\'t know. I understand that. It\\'s not even to be laughed at. They don\\'t know. \"Where do you live?\" I don\\'t know. Mexico, maybe, Honduras, Guatemala, who knows? El Salvador. \"Where do you live?\" Like this guy, he\\'s a Mexican. You\\'re about as Mexican as I am. Look at this guy. He\\'s as Mexican as I am. Look at that hat. Are you Mexican? Are you Mexican? No, you\\'re not. Are you? He is. It\\'s like Elizabeth Warren. She said she was an Indian. I said, \"I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none. She said, \"Oh, this is terrible.\" So she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her. Right? 1024th, right? One thousandths, so I was right. I probably have more in me. What a phony she is. What a phony. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 Congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders\\' healthcare takeover. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security, and they are going to destroy your social security. Remember they used to say with me, \"I\\'m going to end it the first day.\" Well, you know what, we\\'re going to soon be four years and all I\\'ve done is make it stronger. You know that. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. You\\'re going to have great health. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember President Obama? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. 28 times. They said, \"Impeach him. You should impeach him.\" 28 times he lied. 28 times on record, \"You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.\" Well, that\\'s not true. It wasn\\'t. Impeach him. We\\'re making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office. We are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they\\'re better plans. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, and we are trying terminate, in the Supreme Court of the United States, the worst healthcare in the world, and we are going to give you the best healthcare you\\'ve ever seen at a low price and again, protecting preexisting conditions. Protecting preexisting conditions. We\\'re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. You know what that is? Surprise. You get all sorts of surprises. We have people that take a blood test in one place, it\\'s $26, and in another place it\\'s $2000. Same blood test, maybe the cheap one is better, who knows? Same blood test. It\\'s wrong. Surprise medical building. Bombed. Out. Billing. I signed an executive order opposing price transparency that\\'s going to be bigger than healthcare, because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. Right? It\\'s a big thing. It\\'s a big thing. We\\'ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. We have given them, and there\\'s a lot of political pressure not to do that, you can understand why. To care for our amazing veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, and nobody said it could be done. So now, instead of waiting in line for days and days, and weeks and weeks to see a doctor, you go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get all fixed up. What a great thing. It\\'s called VA Choice. I got it done. They\\'ve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they haven\\'t been able to. Those people over there were a great help. We have passed the spectacular Right to Try. You know what that is? Hopefully nobody in the room needs. Hopefully nobody in the room needs Right to Try. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We\\'ve launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer\\'s, and we\\'re pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America\\'s youngest patients, and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb, right up until the very moment of birth. How about that? That is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. Then you have the Governor of Virginia. The baby is born. The baby is born and he says, \"And then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby.\" This is the Governor of Virginia. The Governor of Virginia. He\\'s a beauty. You remember what he did? He wanted to dance like Michael Jackson and his wife stopped him. He got lucky. But the Governor of Virginia wanted to do that. The baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother. The doctor will now talk, and you\\'ll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives. Did you ever hear of anything like this? The Democratic party is the party of high taxes, high crime, unlimited regulations, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. So many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight, and we\\'re doing it for school choice, so that every child who needs it, gets it. No parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Alice Johnson, do we love Alice Johnson? This could not have been done by anyone other than the Republican party. I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our historic investments in the United States military include $200 million to a place that nobody\\'s heard of in this audience, I\\'m sure, Fort Bragg. $300 million for Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. More than $500 million for Marine Corps Air Station New River. Listen to this one. No Democrat\\'s going to this. They don\\'t even want to spend money on the military. They don\\'t like the military. They\\'re not going to spend money. $1.2 billion for Camp Lejeune. $1.2 billion. Do you think that a guy like sleepy Joe\\'s going to put, he doesn\\'t know what it means. I know what I means. We have to have a strong military. We have the strongest military we\\'ve ever had. When I came in, our military was in sad shape. It was depleted, but we\\'ve rebuilt it, $2.5 trillion dollars went into our military. 01] is the actual survival of an our nation itself. If you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of Americans who fought and died to secure, and you know what they\\'re securing, they are securing us, they\\'re securing our freedom, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November, November 3rd to be exact. Only this way can we save the America we love, and drain the Washington swamp, which is by the way, much more vicious, much dirtier, much deeper than I ever thought, but we are kicking ass. With your help, we will lift billions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration, and we will continue with the great Thom Tillis. We will get Thom Tillis. Thom, I don\\'t think anybody even wants to run against you, Thom, but we\\'re going to reelect Thom Tillis. Is that right? We\\'re going to reelect Thom Tillis. If we don\\'t, I\\'m going to be so angry at you. I\\'ll only come back here a few times a year. No, Thom is going to be great. Thom, I think you\\'re in great shape. I think you\\'re in great shape. One more hand for Thom Tillis, please. We don\\'t even know who\\'s running against him. Nobody wants the run. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right? Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in less than nine years. We\\'ve already started. Who would have thought? We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. Your second amendment rights are under siege. Believe me, they\\'re under siege. We don\\'t get in, you can forget your second amendment. That\\'s what I think. I really believe it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that binds us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust. From Fayetteville to Wilmington, from Raleigh to Greensboro, from Asheville to Kitty Hawk, to right here in Charlotte, this state is the home to some of the toughest men and strongest women, and most incredible patriots ever to walk the face of the Earth. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, blazed the trail, sailed the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two world wars, defeated fascism, and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, that\\'s what\\'s happening. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Because together, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we have made America great again. Thank you. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you.\\nThank you very much. Thank you, Minnesota. This is a great state. We are going to win this state in a very short period of time. Thank you. This feels like the day before the election. So we have 20,000-plus people inside. We just set a new record. And we have 25,000 people that we still love, outside. And close to 100,000 people wanted to come tonight. Thank you all. This is great. This is really great. Thank you. I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, and Karen Pence, for being here tonight. It is great to be back in the Twin Cities with the freedom-loving American patriots who make our country run. You know that. You know it. For the next 13 months, think of that, it seems like yesterday, for the next 13 months, we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul, and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020. America now has the number one economy anywhere in the world, and it\\'s not even close. You know I\\'m dealing with China right now. They\\'re in Washington. We\\'re going to see if we make a deal. But they want to make it. We\\'re going to determine whether or not we want to make it. But they\\'ve been very nice. And today I got a call from one of the top representatives, he said, \"Congratulations, Mr. President, on having a truly great, great economy.\" That\\'s pretty nice. We picked up, since the election, trillions of dollars in value. And China has lost trillions of dollars in value. I will say this, if our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now China would become the … It would be the number one economy anywhere in the world. And right now I can tell you they\\'re not even close. Our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting, for the first time in a long time, we are putting America first.  cops love Trump, Trump loves cops. Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know what\\'s happened, it\\'s enraged the failed ruling class in Washington. Not easy to get them out, but we\\'re doing it slowly, but surely. These corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding America dry. And they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country. And that\\'s what they were doing. And that\\'s what they continue to try and do. That is why, from day one, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016. They\\'re trying. They\\'re not getting very far. They want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice. And they want to erase your future. But they will fail, because in America, the people rule again. Do you remember that, just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, The Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesn\\'t know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case, they might\\'ve gotten it pretty correct, they said, \"The Campaign To Impeach President Trump Has Begun.\" That was the headline. Little did we know they weren\\'t playing games. Think of that. That was 19 minutes after the oath of office. Months earlier, Peter Strzok, remember, he and his lover, Lisa Page. What a group. \"She\\'s going to win 10 million to one. She\\'s going to win. I\\'m telling you, Peter. I\\'m telling you, Peter, she\\'s going to win. Peter. Oh, I love you so much.\" \"I love you, Peter.\" \"I love you too, Lisa. Lisa, I love you. Lisa, Lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa. And if she doesn\\'t win, Lisa, we\\'ve got an insurance policy, Lisa. We\\'ll get that son of a bitch out. We got an insurance policy.\" And we\\'re living through the insurance policy. That\\'s what it is. The phony Russia hoax. \" Lisa, I love you.\" Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate. 13 months, they got to move fast, because they\\'re not beating us at the polls and they know it, despite the phony polls that you see all the time, their phony polls. You know, polls are no different. Remember I always used to talk about polls, I know polls very well. Polls are no different than crooked writers. They\\'re crooked polls. They\\'re crooked polls. No different. Boy, that\\'s a lot of media. Look back there. That\\'s a lot of media. They are so dishonest. And frankly, they are so bad for our country. They are so bad. And they could be so good for our country. They could be so good. And maybe they\\'ll change, and maybe they won\\'t. I\\'ve been waiting for a long time. After I won the last election, I said, \"Finally it\\'s okay. Finally I\\'ll get some great press.\" They got worse. They got worse. I said, \"Finally, we\\'re going to get …\" I said to the first lady, \"Darling, we\\'re going to finally get respect. We\\'re going to finally get media and press coverage. It\\'s going to be great. Look at what we\\'ve done.\" And I\\'m telling you, they did, they got worse. They know they cannot win. You understand. Well, if you didn\\'t understand, honestly, there\\'s no way anybody could win, because you\\'d believe them. If you believe them, there\\'s no way anybody could … Because it\\'s like 94% … I can do the greatest things in history, and they\\'ll make them bad to very bad. And if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, it\\'s like, \"Give him the electric chair. That was terrible.\" Right? No, this is the worst. These people and the Democrats, they\\'re partners. It\\'s a partnership. How about on the newscast, like the word \"manufactured,\" it\\'s manu… And every newscast, \"Tonight, in a manufactured deal along the border …\" The word\\'s never been used … All of a sudden every newscast is using it. It\\'s a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats. So they know they can\\'t win the 2020 election, so they\\'re pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt. I\\'ve been going through it now for more time than I\\'ve been in office. Because, like Strzok with his insurance deal, this was before, remember this, this was before, that statement was made months before I took office. That statement was made months before the election took place. They said, \"Just in case, we\\'re going to have an insurance policy.\" That only means one thing, \"We\\'re going to get him out.\" So they\\'re telling us. We can\\'t let that ever happen again to another president. And Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, a lot of people, the great Mark Levin. We have a lot of great people. Lou Dobbs, great people. You know what they said? Every one of them, plus many others, \"There\\'s no other man that we\\'ve ever met that could have taken it.\" It\\'s true. Maybe I\\'m a little different up here. I don\\'t know. But I enjoy it. To me, I\\'m energized because we\\'re draining the swamp. The Democrats\\' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country. These are bad people. My phone call, as an example, with the president of Ukraine, was perfect. Everybody that looked at it. And the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative. So I had no choice. And I don\\'t want to do that as president, every time a president from a country calls me, or I call them, we have to release the text. How can you do business that way? Who\\'s going to want to speak to your president? So the president of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference, on other subjects, that he was under absolutely no pressure. He doesn\\'t even know what they\\'re talking about. And he used the word, there was no \"blackmail\" during this call. He used that term. So in theory, that should be the end of it. Think of it, a president of the United States who\\'s made our economy, with a lot of help from all of you, frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us, we made this the strongest economy in our history. We\\'ve rebuilt our military. We\\'re taking care of healthcare like nobody\\'s been able to do. What we\\'ve done is incredible. And by the way, we\\'re protecting your Second Amendment. If you don\\'t have me, your Second Amendment is gone. So we have the greatest economy, the greatest military. We\\'ve rebuilt our military, $2. 5 trillion, because when I took it over, it was a mess. And what do they want to do? \"Let\\'s impeach our president,\" right? I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think so. I think we\\'re going to have a turnout the likes of which we\\'ve never seen in the history of our country. So we were really forced, just to put it away, we were forced. I said, \"Just do it.\" Got the approval from Ukraine. I have to ask. I said, \"Hey, do you guys mind?\" They said, \"That\\'s a strange request.\" I said, \"Don\\'t worry about it. Do you mind?\" And they said, \"Please, go ahead. Nothing was said wrong on that call.\" So we released the transcript of the call, which was so good that that crooked Adam Schiff, this guy is crooked, he had to make up a fake conversation that never happened- A fake conversation that never happened, and he delivered it to the United States Congress and the American people. It was a total fraud. And then Nancy Pelosi said, \"Oh, I think the president said that.\" These people are sick. I\\'m telling you, they\\'re sick. And you know what? Had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word. It would\\'ve been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early, they said all these horrible things. You know why? Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call. So Nancy Pelosi, upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call, or somebody gave her very bad advice, but also hearing it from shifty shift Nancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian president, \"We\\'ve got to impeach him. We\\'ve got to impeach him.\" Right? And then she saw the call and she said to her people, \"What the hell? Nobody ever told me this was the call.\" But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands. The do nothing democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally, and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual, beautiful, accurate phone call with a foreign leader. I don\\'t think so. As our brilliant White House counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said, \"Their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people.\" That\\'s what it is. To the American people. It\\'s so terrible. Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy. That\\'s what\\'s happening. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them. I mean, look at their debates. These people are crazy. They want to spend $99 trillion to redo buildings all over the United States. I said, \"What about China? What about Russia? What about India? What about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out?\" It\\'s all right. Let him give you the answer. Man, did the cops act fast. He\\'s already gone. That\\'s unbelievable. That\\'s the fastest … You know I have … Look, I love law enforcement. I love the cops. I love the police, all of it. Minneapolis, Minneapolis, you\\'ve got a rotten man. You\\'ve got to change your mayor. You\\'ve got a bad mayor. You\\'ve got a bad mayor. But you know what? The police … I\\'ve done this a lot and every once in a while we\\'ll have very little disturbance. It\\'s really … Actually, is there any place where we can have more fun than at a Trump rally? And we\\'ve set every record at every place, virtually, that we\\'ve gone. And one of the big musicians said, \"And Trump does it without a guitar.\" Can you believe it? Without a guitar. But this guy … So I\\'ve had it a lot where … But sometimes it\\'ll take the police like 30 seconds, 50 seconds. It\\'s like Roger Penske when you watch him, who\\'s getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by the way, pretty soon. He won 18 Indy 500s, 18, Roger Penske. But it\\'s like the way they change those tires, takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing. I say, \"How the hell do they do it?\" That\\'s the way these cops just reacted. That was a record. I think it was a … I\\'ve had good service, but I\\'ve never had anything like that. I look up, the guy is already gone. Ah, we love you with the red shirts. So now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe Biden. And you know what? I\\'d love to run against him, to be honest. Anybody like that. If you can\\'t beat him in a debate, you\\'ve got a big problem folks. You can\\'t beat him in a debate, you can\\'t be president. Because what are you going to do against President Xi and Kim Jong Un. You can\\'t beat sleepy Joe, but now we\\'re going to meet with Kim Jong Un? I don\\'t think so. But he\\'s totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years. Two months after president Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy. Listen to this. And the press will not write it. They say, \"In totally unsubstantiated charges …\" every time they talk about him. President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune. Now you know that\\'s a totally unsubstantiated charge. Really? It\\'s not an unsubstantiated, it\\'s fact. Joe\\'s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days. By the way, whatever happened to Hunter. Where the hell is he? Where\\'s Hunter? Hey fellows, I have an idea for a new t-shirt. I love the cops, but let\\'s do another t-shirt. Where\\'s Hunter? Where is he? Here\\'s Hunter, being examined by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd or some of these people. Hunter, it\\'s so great that you\\'re here, sir. Hunter, I know they\\'re giving you approximately $168,000 a month. I hear they paid you a big check of $3 million. I just want to speak on behalf of NBC who\\'s absolutely one of the worst. I just want to tell you … Hunter, Hunter I just want to tell you I couldn\\'t be happier for you and your family and I know you don\\'t know anything about energy and I know it\\'s an energy company, but I think they made a great deal, Hunter. And then they fly to China, and I\\'m dealing with people right now. They\\'re tough as hell, those Chinese negotiators, and Hunter, who\\'s not too smart, Hunter. He goes in, he has a meeting, he walks out in his fund with 1.5 billion, with a B, one point five billion dollars. These aren\\'t the same Chinese negotiators that I\\'m dealing with, I can tell you. These are not the same ones, but we are doing very well in that negotiation. Now, think of it, where\\'s Hunter? Where is Hunter? I want to see Hunter? Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you\\'re a loser. Why did you get one point five billion dollars, Hunter. And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good Senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\\'s ass. True. Thank you. Thank you. It\\'s true. It\\'s true. And they\\'re always saying the same thing. Yeah, he got a billion five, we admit it, they admit it, it\\'s nothing, but oh, it\\'s not that same thing, president Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about Hunter Biden and his father. It\\'s not unsubstantiated, you crooked son of a guns, it\\'s 100% true. 100%. Even the smart guys on Wall Street, and I know all of them, they are smart. They\\'ve never seen anything like that one before. I\\'ve called them. Does that ever happen? Never happens. Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing. Walks out with a billion five. Gee. Flies in on Air Force Two with his father, the vice president. Don\\'t forget, that\\'s when he was vice president. So China gives his son 1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think so. Meanwhile, Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president, and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we\\'re not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich and that is substantiated. While America got robbed, that\\'s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends out America, they didn\\'t have tough negotiations. I look at these trade deals and I say, \"Who the hell could have done this?\" If you didn\\'t … If you had no business instinct, no business ability, if you had nothing, if you\\'re dumb as hell, you wouldn\\'t make these deals, they\\'re so bad. I say, \"Who made these deals? Who made these deals?\" But we\\'re ripping them all up and redoing them and they\\'re going to be very good. Wait until you see what happens. Now that I\\'m your president, you see it. America is winning again and we\\'re respected again as a nation. A brand new report just came out as I\\'m walking on the stage. Hard to believe, actually. It turns out that Joe Biden was vice president, he worked with the so called whistle blower. This is nothing but a partisan witch hunt, sabotage, and I\\'m sure they\\'re going to say it\\'s totally unsubstantiated, but one of them wrote this story. Congratulations, by the way. That\\'s very nice. That\\'s really good. That\\'s the way you should do it. Good. Good. Good. In the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media, it\\'s okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries, flood our communities with drugs and crime, and enrich themselves at America\\'s expense. Their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game, and it is far more rigged. When I ran, I thought it was rigged, but this is crazy what\\'s happening. But if you refuse to bow or bend to the Washington swamp, which I could do very easily, I\\'d be much more popular. Folks, it would be so much easier. But they smear you, they spy on you, and they target your friends, your family, your staff for harassment, for abuse, for destruction. I came down to Washington with incredible people. We won a great political campaign. They were bright eyed and bushy tailed. that\\'s a nice phrase. They came down, they were happy. They wanted to turn the country around. They wanted to do great things. All of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller. How good was he as a witness? Not too good and by people that were, I call them the 13 angry Democrats, that turned into 18 angry Democrats. It was disgraceful. So people that were going down, \"Sir, what is this?\" I look, \"Oh wow, that\\'s a subpoena.\" What the hell is this? They took people … I really mean this. They took people that were full of life and energy and vigor. We had just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics, it\\'s true. It\\'s true. And they destroyed their lives. They destroyed their lives. They went home. I could name many people, one in particular, who came down, an incredible young woman. She was going to help people. She wanted to help people. She had causes that were so good. She wanted to help people, and she ended up going home, dark, dark. Her life became hell. They ruined people. They destroyed people, good people. People that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made. Than they made. They destroyed great people. They\\'re vicious, horrible, and the media was behind every single step. They destroyed so many lives. They destroyed so many lives, and they\\'re continuing to do it. And it\\'s a disgrace. When all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds, these sinister fakers then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption. There\\'s nothing like the dirty political establishment, and I have to tell you, this is, friend of mine, very smart, brilliant guy, was with me about two weeks ago. We just got rid of the Russia hoax and then a week later the Ukraine hoax starts. I had a week of like, \"I can think about everything perfect. It\\'s so beautiful.\" And he said, \"President.\" I said, \"Call me Donald. You\\'ve called me Donald for 35 years.\" \"I will. Thank you Donald.\" I\\'ve lost all my friends because they\\'re all scared to talk. Honestly, I\\'m the president that they can\\'t talk to me anymore. It\\'s like they\\'re afraid. They respect the office. It\\'s true. They say, \"President.\" I say, \"Do me a favor, Richard. You\\'ve called me Donald for 35 years. Call me Donald, please. I want somebody to call me Donald.\" True. He said to me, I just told him call me … He said, \"President, I can\\'t do it.\" He said. So he says, \"President, you\\'ve been here now for, think of it, almost three years. Can you believe we\\'re here three years?\" We, we, it\\'s we. And we have to promise them no more than 16 years. Okay? No more. No more. 16 more years. I\\'m only kidding. Now they\\'ll go back. See, he wants to run for more. But he said, \"President, could I ask you a question? It\\'s so important to me.\" He\\'s a great businessman, very successful. He said, \"You deal with all of these nations, these great, powerful … Who is the worst to deal with? Is it China? Is it North Korea? Is India? Is it Russia? Please tell me, Mr. Pres, who is the toughest nation to deal with?\" I said, \"You\\'re not going to believe this. It\\'s the USA is the toughest nation to deal with.\" The USA. It\\'s true. Because we\\'re dealing with some very sick and deranged people. There is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate, own and control. They\\'re trying to stop me because they know that I don\\'t answer to them, I answer to you. It\\'s true. I never say this. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever said it in a speech, but they\\'ll find out if I did. They\\'ll give me Pinocchios, he said it before, but I don\\'t know if I ever said this before. But I make, as president, about $450,000. I give it away. I don\\'t care. I don\\'t want it. I never hear anything. Can you imagine if I didn\\'t. I give it away to … You can only give it, you can\\'t keep it. You can\\'t actually make a gift. You can give it to your different agencies. So I can give it to health, I can give it to transportation, I can give it to military, but I give it away all the time. Now, and if I ever did … But it\\'s 450. If somebody stays from, let\\'s say, a middle East country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying, and I never heard of the guy and I don\\'t want to hear about him, they say, \"Trump is getting rich off our nation.\" I lose billions being president. I don\\'t care. It\\'s nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions. If somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees, I never heard of the people. I never know who they are. They say, \"Emoluments.\" Nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before. Emoluments. It\\'s the craziest thing I\\'ve ever seen. I tell you, it\\'s cost me billions of dollars to be president. It really has. And at some point I\\'ll probably to prove that, and I look forward to doing it.. It\\'s very easy. It\\'s very easy. And there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created. So in desperate attempt to attack our movement. Nancy and Chuck, two beauties, have given control of the Democrat party entirely over to the radical left, including Minnesota\\'s own representative Ilhan Omar. I know you people. I know you people. I know the people of Minnesota, and I want to tell you, and I also, at the same time, it\\'s both a question and a statement, how\\'d the hell did that ever happen? How did it happen? How did it happen? Congresswoman Omar is an America hating socialist. She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland. Where far more than 3,000 people died, saying, \"Some people did something big deal. Some people did something.\" She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota. Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda. You remember that tape? Speak of Al-Qaeda. But when we say something about the United States, you just don\\'t say America with any intensity. Remember that? Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not. She\\'s said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country. Omar wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States. How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I\\'m very angry at you people right now. She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I\\'m going to win, and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months. Thank you very much. So we\\'re honored to have with us today a special guest, a man that really is a terrific talented writer. He knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of Omar. Mr. Scott Johnson of Power Line. He wrote some stuff, I can\\'t believe it. Where\\'s Scott? Where\\'s Scott? Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Scott. What a job. Man, do you have her figured out. The only problem is, Scott, it\\'s incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about. The problem is they never pick it up. They don\\'t want to pick it up, but we pick it up, Scott, and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting. Thank you. Thank you very much. And Scott reported everything about Omar is a fraud, including her name. Scott reports his sources told him that, quote, Omar\\'s legal husband was Omar\\'s brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes. You mean like coming into the United States, maybe? And as Scott says, \"We have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like Omar\\'s in Congress, and nothing gets done about it.\" I hope that some of you people are looking, because what AOC has gotten away with campaign financing and what … I call it AOC plus three, that\\'s what it is. And Omar is one of the three. What AOC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse, and nothing happens to them, but it happens to you, and it\\'s not fair. The fact is, we\\'re in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America. The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand- Message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020. With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate and we will win the White House. And we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much. One of your tremendous talented, tough, Congressman Tom Emmer. Tom. Also a man, you don\\'t want to fight him, and you don\\'t want to play him in hockey because he was tough. He just won, not that recently but pretty recently, and I was out here campaigning for him and working hard, and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him. Congressman Pete Stauber. And a man who gets in the trenches, and he just doesn\\'t care. He wants to win for the people. He loves you. He loves this state. He loves this country. Jim Hagedorn. Thank you. And a great friend of mine with his incredible family. He\\'s a friend. He\\'s smart. I guess you\\'d say he\\'s brilliant. His education is incredible, his military career has been incredible. Then he ran for office, and now he\\'s a United States Senator from the great state of Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton. Great guy. And Minnesota Senate Majority Leader, Paul Gazelka. Paul. Thank you Paul. Minnesota GOP Chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan. She\\'s been incredible. I said, \"Jennifer, are we going to win in 13 months?\" She said, \"Honestly sir, I\\'ve never seen anything like this. It\\'s going to be easy. Don\\'t ever say… Just assume we\\'re two points behind, okay?\" Two points behind. You never ever… Please. Always just assume you\\'re a little behind, but we\\'re going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked. Ad plenty of other states too. We had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico, and New Mexico\\'s a hard state for Republicans, hasn\\'t been won in a long time also. And we had receptivity that was unbelievable. The audience was 40% Hispanic, where we\\'re doing great. And you know, Hispanic, they understand borders better than anybody, better than we do. They understand safety, they understand their job, they don\\'t want people taking it away, they don\\'t want crime. They understand it better. That\\'s why we\\'re doing so well, but we\\'re in New Mexico, and I\\'m telling you, that was electric. But honestly, all evenings are electric. We haven\\'t had any bad ones. We haven\\'t. They\\'re all electric. A woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me, a state that hadn\\'t been won in a long time by a Republican for whatever reason, but it hadn\\'t been won. I guess we didn\\'t have the right candidates, right? But a woman who would call me constantly. I\\'d say, \"I don\\'t want to talk to her. She\\'s giving me a headache.\" \"Sir, if you make one more trip, you\\'re going to win Michigan.\" I say, \"All right,\" I make the trip, I go back home. I get a call the next morning, \"Sir, we need one more.\" This went over and over and over, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan, and I said, \"Who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan and speak just one more time every week? One more time, sir.\" And her name is Ronna McDaniel. She\\'s fantastic, and she\\'s the head of the RNC. She\\'s great. And our campaign manager, a man who\\'s really been… They used to say that Crooked Hillary had a very very sophisticated campaign. After she lost, they said, \"I guess it wasn\\'t sophisticated.\" We had a sophisticated campaign. Nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy. Brad Parscale. Remember when they used to say it? You know, I never got credit. My father used to teach me, if you can do it for less and win, that\\'s good. He wasn\\'t talking politics. The last thing… He\\'s looking down. He\\'s definitely looking down, not looking up. He was great. He was tough, but he was great. But my father would say, \"If you could do it for less and win, that\\'s a good thing, not a bad thing. If you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street, and if it\\'s a nicer building and you can rent for less, you\\'re really… That\\'s like a good thing.\" So in the campaign, we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary Clinton, much. And we won. And we won. We won 306 to 223. That\\'s a pretty big… Remember? Remember they said electoral college. By the way, when you run, if you\\'re running, the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash, and the total vote, you don\\'t go certain places. You focus. Electoral college. We have to explain to them, it\\'s different. So we won 306, and do you remember they sued to say one\\'s the 100 yard dash. You practice. One\\'s the mile. You practice. It\\'s a different race. Winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion. The electoral college, I had to go to 22 different states. For the total vote, I\\'d go to four states maximum, right? Much easier. It\\'s much easier. I\\'m all for it, but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn\\'t go. I love Maine. I went to Maine four or five times. I needed one point. Maine gave me one point. And what happened? What happened? I went there numerous times. Everyone said, \"Why?\" Because I was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that Trump cannot get to 270. He cannot get… They had me maximum, if everything worked, right? At 269. So I kept going to Maine, and you know what? We won that one point in Maine. We won it. It\\'s true. But I kept going. They say, \"Why?\" I said, \"Well, first of all, it is really a beautiful place,\" but we won the point. But they said, \"He can not get to 270,\" and I heard this for months and months. I had such a headache, almost as bad as listening to Mike\\'s damn commercials about those pillows. Maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache. Does it cure headaches? I think so. But here\\'s the thing. Here\\'s the thing. So they said, \"He cannot get to 270.\" In other words, you can\\'t win. You don\\'t get to 270, it\\'s over. You can\\'t win, right? He cannot do it. There\\'s no way of doing it, and they were right. I got to 306. They were right. But I didn\\'t get to 306. You got to 306. We won incredible states. We won incredible states. We won Wisconsin, we won Michigan, we won Pennsylvania, we won North Carolina, we won South Carolina, we won Florida. What a run. Do you remember the evening that we won? I think… Look, forgetting me, I think it was won of all of us together because we all worked hard. I was the messenger, but we all worked hard. That was our victory, not my victory. But that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television, one of the greatest nights, and hopefully it\\'ll go down when we\\'re allowed to get all of this stuff seeded… You know, it\\'s like a tree. You plant it. You plant it. It has to go, but it needs a little… That\\'s why we need the four more additionally years. It\\'s got to grab on and catch, so they can\\'t destroy it. So they can\\'t destroy it. But I think it\\'ll go down, and I hope it\\'s going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country, because it\\'s never happened, anything like that before. And these guys don\\'t even question it. They just sit back and say, \"I guess he\\'s right about that.\" I\\'ll never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena. The place was going crazy. It was like this, going crazy, and two reporters that hate my guts, they looked at themselves, they looked at each other. Famous shot. They\\'re looking like this and they\\'re saying, \"What the hell is going on?\" They knew. They knew. And I didn\\'t need Beyonce and Jay Z, and I didn\\'t need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people. They\\'d get all these people. They\\'d come in because she couldn\\'t get a crowd. They\\'d come in, they\\'d sing. They got Bruce Springsteen. Okay? He\\'d do about two songs and leave. What happens is, they leave, and then everyone leaves with them, and she\\'s still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd. It\\'s the craziest thing I\\'ve ever seen. And then they complain. Sometimes I\\'ll use terrible word like hell. The other day I used the word hell. I got hell from… They said, \"He used terrible language.\" I used the word hell. It was so bad. But you\\'ve got to hear Jay Z, the words he was using, he was using the F word all over the place, and then the next day they say I use bad language. The word hell is a terrible word. These people are sick. But that was an amazing evening. I\\'ll never forget that evening. Look. Outside of your family and your children and things… I love you too, darling. It was one of the highest rated evenings in the history of television. You add up all those networks. Remember the woman crying? Oh my God. No, they weren\\'t biased at all. Now, another very special man who\\'s with us today, but he\\'ll never be a man to me, he\\'ll always be my boy, you know what I mean? Right? He\\'s my boy. He\\'s my little six foot six boy, Eric Trump. And the parents understand that, right? They may be big and strong and older. To a parent, a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl, and I know that\\'s probably politically incorrect. They\\'ll say, \"It was terrible what he said about women. Terrible.\" But they\\'re our boy and they\\'re our girl, and it doesn\\'t matter how old we get and how old they get, is that a correct statement? And I\\'m also proud to endorse your next Republican Senator from Minnesota, a man that I\\'ve known, a man that is tough and smart, a man that\\'s running against somebody that\\'s never done a damn thing in the Senate, Mr. Jason Lewis. And Jason did a great job in Congress. Congressman Lewis, thank you very much, and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s going to be nasty. It\\'s going to be nasty. They\\'re going to make up stories about you. They\\'re going to say things that\\'s going to want to make your wife say, \"Why did I marry this guy?\" Just say, \"Don\\'t worry about it. It\\'s just another phony story.\" Thank you very much Mr. and Mrs. Lewis. Jason, thank you. And Jason, they can say that about Tom Cotton. He\\'s too perfect, this guy. He can\\'t say… They can\\'t say it about you, Tom. Anyway, good luck Jason. Do well. And I don\\'t know why, but with all of the great people I just introduced, for tonight, maybe this is the most important person, because I turned on a very good show in the morning. Fox and friends. They treat us great. I just want fairness. What a great group. Ainsley and Steve, and by the way, Brian has gotten a lot better, right? And how good does Jessie Waters do? How good? Right? Just some really great people. And again, Tucker\\'s been very good I have to say. He\\'s been good. Smart. He\\'s been great. Tucker, and the legendary Sean Hannity. Great. Number one. Number one show. Sean\\'s got the number one show. And Laura Ingraham is knocking them out of the park, Laura. And you go over, Maria Bartiromo, and the great Lou Dobbs. How good are they? Lou Dobbs. And many more. And many more. How about Greg? Greg used to hate me. Now, he\\'s good. Oh, we can\\'t forget… We can\\'t forget Judge Jeanine. I would be in such trouble if I forgot Judge Jeanine. No, these are… And there are many more. I just… Look, I\\'m just rattling some names off, but they\\'re just terrific people. They\\'re terrific people. But a man that I have to really say something very special about… 00 slot, because I\\'m out of there pretty good, and I see a handsome young man named Bob Kroll, Cops For Trump. And he\\'s talking about this lousy mayor they\\'ve got. Now, he didn\\'t quite say that, but I say it. He\\'s talking about this lousy mayor that won\\'t let the cops, the police, the law enforcement… My father always used to say, \"Son…\" And he meant it to. \"Never say cops. It\\'s disrespectful. Say police officer.\" I said, \"Okay Pop.\" But honestly, the truth is with time, I love you guys whether you\\'re cops, police officers, law enforcement. I\\'ll call you whatever you want. It doesn\\'t matter. You are so great, so respected. You don\\'t even know how much our public loves you. You don\\'t know it. You don\\'t know it. You don\\'t know it. But I see this guy, and I don\\'t know if he\\'s done a lot of television before, but he was very effective and very good. And he was saying how the police aren\\'t being allowed to take care of this rally, and yet with President Obama and Bush and all these people, they were fine, fine. Everybody comes. They fall asleep at a rally. But they weren\\'t allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild. So what I want to do… Go home to Mommy. Mommy says, \"I saw you on television tonight. I love Trump. Don\\'t you ever do that again.\" \"Yes Mom. Yes Mom.\" But the job he did before the election, I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledged to address this really important issue, and it\\'s the issue of law enforcement. And when I saw this man, this great gentleman on television pouring out his guts, pouring out his heart… I don\\'t know him. He knows I\\'ve been good to law enforcement. He knows I\\'ve been good to, as my father would say, \"The police.\" He knows I love the cops. He knows that, and so does everyone else. I mean, it\\'s so many shirts, so many red shirts, and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts, and I want to just tell you, the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound. It\\'s unbound. Come up here. Bob, come up. Say something. Thank you fellas. I\\'ll see you later. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great people. Thank you. What a group. I think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on. As you know, for many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers. I promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy, and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls. And I\\'ve done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise. I issued an executive action, making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to your mayor. You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that\\'s what you have the right to do right now. And believe me, no other president would be doing that. If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before. Do you think you have it bad now? You would never have seen anything like what they want to do. But in the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota. We\\'ve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place. We are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. The president of Mexico has been incredible. We have now, 27,000 Mexican soldiers. They\\'re great, and they\\'re tough, and they are now protecting our border, and those numbers have gone down like this. Thank you Mr. President. We will not make the mistakes made in European countries, that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country, on our shores. We\\'re not going to allow it to happen. And as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us, I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get, travel ban on some of the world\\'s most dangerous countries. And the other day, one of the fake news reporters in the back said… They were talking about the travel ban, and they said, \"Well you know, the president has lost in court.\" They said, \"Where?\" \"On the travel ban.\" And he\\'s right. I lost, and then I lost at the appellate division, and then I won at the United States Supreme Court. Right? And he knew that, but he said I lost on the… And he was right. I lost, and then I lost again, but then I won, and we have the travel ban. But instead of saying, \"He lost, and then he lost at the appellate, and then he won at the United States Supreme Court,\" he said, \"He lost on the travel ban.\" These are very dishonest people. Do you understand that? Very dishonest people. In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities, and we\\'re not letting it happen anymore. Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal aliens. My administration is taking historic action to secure the border. We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built. And this is a serious wall. You\\'ve all seen it. It\\'s going up rapidly, and you think that was easy? I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me. I had a lot of the rhinos fighting me. They say, \"See, he\\'s not getting it built. He\\'s not getting…\" Let me tell you. You have every Democrat fighting you. We took it from here, and we took it from there, and we took it from all over the place, and we got that thing. That\\'s the biggest patchwork of financing you\\'ve ever seen, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, it\\'s largely 30 feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted. I went to the Border Patrol, and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said, \"What do you want? What\\'s your ideal?\" I actually said, \"I want to give you the Rolls Royce,\" and they killed me for that. They said, \"It\\'s not an American made product.\" Yeah, they happened to be right. No, they\\'re right about that one. They\\'re actually right there, Tom. But I said, \"I want to give you the Rolls Royce of walls. Tell me.\" And they told me everything, and then we built some alternative walls. We built all different types. We built about seven of them, and then we had climbers come in. The one that worked the best was the one we\\'re building. It also, unfortunately… The bad news, it\\'s also the most expensive. But we got it for the right price. We got it for the right price. It\\'s steel, it\\'s hardened concrete, it\\'s deep, it\\'s high, it\\'s a thing of beauty. And it\\'s going to keep bad people out of our country. That\\'s what it\\'s going to do. And the Democrats knew this. Most of the Democrats four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now all of a sudden, they don\\'t want a wall. You know why they don\\'t want a wall? Because I want it. That\\'s the only reason. And I just thought of it a year ago. I said, \"Man, this could\\'ve been so much easier.\" All I had to do is say, \"We don\\'t want a wall,\" and they would\\'ve given me all the financing I wanted for the wall. What was I thinking? We\\'re not going to build a wall, and they would have forced me to build it. I would\\'ve… It\\'s true. Under this administration, we are also ending the- … this administration. We are also ending the endless wars. We have to do it, folks. We have to do it. We have totally defeated the ISIS caliphate, and I did that in rather quick time if you remember, because we have the greatest fighting machine, now. When I came in and was totally depleted. We have great generals, we have great warfighters, and they did it so fast. I flew to Iraq, I met with the generals, right? I met with the generals. I said, \"I hear it\\'s going to take a year to two years.\" \"Sir, we can do it in two weeks.\" I said, \"What?\" \"They don\\'t let us fight, sir. They don\\'t let us fight. We want to fight. They don\\'t let us fight.\" I said, \"I let you fight.\" I said, \"How come if they say it\\'s going to take anywhere from a year to two years, you say you can do it so quickly?\" He said, \"Sir, we\\'re going to hit them from the front. We\\'re going to hit them from the back. We\\'re going to hit them from the sides, from underground, from overground. We going to hit the hell out of them.\" And they did. And we won very quickly. But from now on, we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the United States of America, not to the benefit of other countries. And we will only fight to win. We\\'re only going to fight to win. We don\\'t fight to win. We don\\'t fight to win. The Turks have been fighting with the Kurds for two centuries, and Turkey, as you know, is a NATO ally. But I\\'ve been rough on them. We\\'ve defeated 100% of that ISIS caliphate, and no longer have any troops in the area. We don\\'t have any troops. The troops have been pulled out. Where Turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the Kurds, get them out. So Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds. We got along with the Kurds, and we helped the Kurds. And don\\'t forget they\\'re also fighting for their land. You know that. But they\\'re fighting. So we have three choices. You\\'re ready? Here are the three choices. We don\\'t have any soldiers there because we\\'ve left. We won. We left. Take a victory, United States. We left. Take a victory, take a victory. Bring our troops back home. I told this story yesterday, I have to sign letters, it\\'s the hardest thing I have to do. I sign letters, \"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Arkansas. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Alabama. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Somebody from some great state, I\\'m sorry to inform you, your son has been killed in combat. I\\'m so sorry.\" And every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents, they\\'re grieving, and they get together with other parents, and I don\\'t want to see that it\\'s like the same letter. So we do different letters. It\\'s the hardest thing I have to do. Hardest thing.it\\'s the hardest thing I have … I was telling Tom Cotton, it\\'s the hardest thing that I have to do. And I sign those letters, and it just, it breaks your heart. And by the way, there\\'s a time to fight. Nobody fights harder than I do. But there\\'s a time, and there\\'s not necessarily a time. But I send these letters out, quite a few. And sometimes I send letters out, it\\'s called blue on green, where we\\'re teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back. And that\\'s the hardest thing for a parent. I have all of them. I know everyone. That\\'s the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification, because they learn how their child has died. When the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them, and shoot. We\\'ve had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than we\\'ve ever had proportionately before. It\\'s a horrible, horrible thing. But I have to sign these letters. And sometimes I go out to a place, Dover Air Force Base, it\\'s a very tough experience. Mike Pence goes, I go, other people go, Tom Cotton goes. We go out there, and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the sisters, the brothers. We meet them, and we talked to them, and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin, and these things are just impossible. I don\\'t know how parents can do it, even. And I\\'ll meet them. And we have a particular Colonel, that\\'s all he does. So good. So professional. That\\'s what he does. He said, \"I greet the dead, sir. I greet the dead.\" And what happens is this big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane, and it flies in so powerful, so big. I\\'ll be talking to some of the parents, and they\\'ll act like they\\'re fine. I said, \"How are you doing?\" \"We\\'re fine, sir. We\\'re fine. We\\'re really good.\" I say, \"That\\'s great.\" And I\\'ll tell the Colonel, I\\'ll say, \"Colonel, I think they\\'re doing great.\" \"No sir, they\\'re not going to do great. You\\'ll see.\" And I didn\\'t know what he was talking about, this is the first time. Then we went outside to the runway, and this incredible machine is flying in, and it lands, and it comes over, and it pulls up, and we have military guards, we have incredible talented musicians that do this. That\\'s what they do. What happens is that door opens up, and the Colonel told me, he said, \"Sir, when that door opens up, those same people that you think are okay, do things that you\\'ll never see. You will hear sounds like you\\'ve never heard.\" That\\'s what he does. I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it. The door was opened, and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane. And I see parents make sounds, that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you\\'ve never seen before. The Colonel was telling me that, \"Sir, you\\'ll see things that you\\'ve never seen before. A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off, and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers, on top of the American flag.\" I\\'ve seen this. Then I have all these people that want to stay. They want to stay. And I don\\'t want to stay. We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. We\\'ve now been there for 10 years. We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time. We\\'re now going to be there for close to 19 years. It\\'s time to bring them home. It\\'s time to bring them home. It\\'s true. Time to bring them home. We\\'ve done our job, we\\'ve defeated everyone that we\\'re supposed to defeat. And now we are, we are policing, we are now policing. That\\'s what we\\'re doing. We\\'re policing. And that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people, and those are police, but we are now policing. We\\'re not fighting, we\\'re policing. And you know what? After all of these years … One other story, and I have to tell you. I go to Walter Reed on Friday, and I do it quite often. I gave out five Purple Hearts. And I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing. I met five warriors, and one was so badly hurt, with the loss of arms and a leg, another one … they\\'re just very, very devastated. But these are great, great people. And I gave out the Purple Heart. And I see the parents, and I have to say, Walter Reed, I want to just say, the doctors there, the job they do, you know, you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets, and the vets\\' care, and nobody\\'s done better. We got choice for the vets. We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible. But I saw these young men, and I gave them their Purple Hearts. And their parents were there crying. And one of them was so amazing. I said, \"What\\'s your problem?\" \"Sir, my face was blown apart. My nose was absolutely just blown apart.\" He said, \"Sir, it\\'s incredible.\" And I looked at him, I said, \"That\\'s the most beautiful nose I\\'ve ever seen. What do you mean?\" He said, \"A doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field. He said there were a thousand fragments.\" Now I don\\'t know if that\\'s right, but well, a lot. He meant a lot. \"He said there were a thousand fragments. He rebuilt my nose with glue. He glued the bones together. He rebuilt my nose.\" I say, \"You have the most beautiful nose I\\'ve ever seen,\" and it\\'s true. And his father came over to me, he said, \"Sir,\" father was crying, he said, \"Sir, honestly, my son looks better now.\" He said, \"My son did not have a good look. He knows. Now look at it, it\\'s beautiful, it\\'s beautiful.\" But these doctors at Walter Reed, and these Army, and Marine, and the medical doctors, they are unbelievably great people. And they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see. They see things that nobody will ever see, and there\\'s nobody like them. And I have to give a shout out to those people, there\\'s nobody like them. So in the case of Turkey, and Syria, and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey. No, you don\\'t want to do that. We could hit Turkey very hard financially. Or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. I like that. You know? Let\\'s mediate a deal. But remember they\\'ve been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case by President Obama. So we did our job. We knocked out. And I\\'ll tell you another thing, we have to be treated fairly. We have to be treated fairly. We\\'re not treated fairly by other nations. We captured many, many ISIS fighters. Most of them came from Europe. They came from Germany. They came from France. They came from all of these countries. And we called them, I called them myself in many cases, I said, \"Take your fighters.\" They said, \"We don\\'t want them. You take them.\" I said, \"No, no, no, we did you a big favor. They\\'re citizens of Germany. They\\'re citizens of France. They\\'re citizens of these various countries in Europe. Take your fighters.\" \"We don\\'t want them, sir. We don\\'t want them.\\' And I said, \"How unfair are we treated? We do them a great favor, and they won\\'t take the fighters.\" So we\\'re doing some things that are pretty amazing. Every once in a while you have to change course, and do what you have to do. The United States has spent $8 trillion in the Middle East. We\\'ve lost thousands of brave soldiers, and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same. These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed. And all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East, really it\\'s less safe, it\\'s less stable, and it\\'s less secure. And I say it all the time. The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East. We spent $8 trillion and lost thousands of lives. And by the way, the other side, we can talk about that, lost millions of lives. What did we do? So we\\'re going to pull them out, and we\\'re pulling people out, and we\\'re trying to make good deals, and we\\'re going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and they\\'ll be ready. Previous administrations lust for regime change, and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started. They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures. The Christians, the Christians. And we work hard with the Christians. We have tremendous evangelical support. We work hard with the Christians. So we\\'re slowly getting out of the Middle East. We\\'re doing it carefully. And we\\'re rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before. When I came into office, a very prominent general told me, because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone, said, \"Sir, we have no ammunition.\" We had old planes. We had planes that were so old, they didn\\'t fly. We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts. I never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again. I never want to have a President hear the words, \"Sir, we have no ammunition.\" Think of that. Think of that. Now, thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else than we\\'ve ever had before. And we have no choice. You look around the world, and we have no choice, unfortunately. And the Democrats want to dismantle our military. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. That\\'s what we have to do. We\\'re replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, a giant victory for our farmers, ranchers, workers in Minnesota. Congress should pass USMCA immediately. We hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense. And to protect our industrial backbone, I placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. I\\'m also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China. And the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open. And they understand that. And I don\\'t blame China for what\\'s taken place over the last 25 years. I blame the people that led our country that let that happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China. It\\'s not China\\'s fault. In the previous administration, they put our nation\\'s natural resources under lock and key, including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called Superior National Forest. Last year, I traveled to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice, reopening Superior National Forest, and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota. Tremendous jobs. And now the iron range is back in business. The last time I was here, a man came up to me, he said, \"Sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away.\\' I\\'ll never forget it. A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes. He said, \"You gave us back our life,\" because they took it away from him. We gave it back. Best iron ore there is anywhere. My administration is also fighting the Democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare. Republicans will protect Medicare, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And for those of you that have private healthcare, health insurance, 180 million people, they are going to end it, obliterate it, and most people are thrilled with it. We are going to leave it. You\\'re going to have your plan the way you want it. And there\\'s no plan like those plans. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb, right up to the moment of birth. That is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant Washington corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it\\'s the party of the American Dream. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You remember that? Gee, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m so sorry. Now you have a President who\\'s standing up for America, we are standing up for Minneapolis, and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota. We begin this political campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. We begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country. Together, we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. With your help, we will reelect, and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Nobody thought that could be done. Going to be done. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our great national motto, In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon. Proud citizens like the people of Minnesota helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Minnesota, I will tell you this with great certainty, the best is yet to come. Thank you very much. And just in concluding, together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you.\\nWow, that\\'s a big crowd. This is a big crowd. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello to Swanton and a load to Toledo. I\\'m thrilled to be back in Ohio with thousands of hardworking, loyal, great American patriots … days from now. Can you believe it, 43 days? We go to again win Ohio. I understand from Bob Paduchik, you know Bob? That we\\'re going to win it by more than we did. Whether we win at nine, we won by nine points. I just came into that big, beautiful place. It\\'s got more televisions in any plane in history. They\\'ve got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor, on the ceilings. I just saw that we\\'re tied in Ohio. I don\\'t think so … President Trump may have a slim lead in Ohio? They\\'re not even campaigning in Ohio, come to think of it. Now, they\\'re fake polls. They\\'re almost as fake as the writers themselves. They\\'re all fake. Remember last time they said, \"No, he\\'s going to lose Ohio.\" We won by nine points. So, we had seven swing states last time. President Trump is going to go home early, but it wasn\\'t president at that time, it was just Donald Trump. He will go home early. We did. That we went home early as victors, but we had nine states. They had one of the crazy papers, New York Times. They hired that guy. They paid him millions because he never predicted wrong. He was wrong. I don\\'t know if they had a contract where they could fire him, but they hired this guy. We had nine states. I was down at all of them on the day of election. I was going to lose all nine, and then guess what? I won every one of them. Fake polls. They\\'re fake polls. Then we have a crowd like this. I don\\'t know. Look, the cameras, are you turning around? These guys are bad people. I swear. They never turn the cameras around, ever. Turn them around. Turn them around. They never tell, look at them. It\\'s just like a bunch of stiffs. Real stiffs. Why don\\'t you turn the cameras around for once? You look back there, you can\\'t see it. There\\'s got to be, feels like Madison Square Garden on the ground except we have more people. Oh boy, it\\'s always tough. You know, we go through this all the time. We\\'re always asking them, look at these crowds. I mean, as far, you can\\'t see it. You have this prime territory, like you should be in the real estate business. Now, as far as the eye can see back there, the cameras don\\'t, they don\\'t get it. You only hear it from the sound. I go home. I say to the first lady, \"Did you see that crowd we had tonight in Ohio?\" She goes, \"No, no. They just keep it on your face.\" That includes Fox. They just keep it here, right here. They don\\'t want to show. You know what they don\\'t know and what they don\\'t get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them. It\\'s positive for their ratings. It\\'s really a good thing, but they don\\'t want to do it, but I give up on it. You know what you do? You hear it because you can\\'t have … You know when sleepy Joe Biden, he\\'s got the circles. You knowthose big circles? You know why he has the circles? He\\'s got four of them, because they can\\'t … I mean, think of it. He is a guy who\\'s failed every time he ran. We called him 1% Joe and now he\\'s shot and he got their nomination. How the hell does that work out? How does that work out? But he\\'s got the circles. He got like four, sometimes he has six because that\\'s a good way of saying, if you don\\'t have any people, just put them in the circle and he\\'s practicing the science. Now it doesn\\'t work out, but we\\'re going to win four more years in the White House. We\\'re doing things that nobody\\'s ever done before. We\\'re doing what nobody\\'s ever done, and thank you for being here. I wish we could move the press back further, if you want to know the truth. As our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice … Thank you everybody. Thank you. So is our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I will soon announce a nominee for the United States Supreme Court. They say it\\'s the most important thing a president can do. I don\\'t know. I think military, maybe. We rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars. Great. We will fill that seat. It\\'s going to go quickly. Probably announced the person. I don\\'t want to make the men too angry. It will be a woman. Is that okay? I don\\'t want to have a problem with men. They\\'ll say Trump is doing very poorly with men. You listen. How\\'s he doing? Well, he\\'s doing very poorly with men, with women. He\\'s doing very poorly with the black community, Hispanic community. Then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma, without diploma, college, PhDs. What\\'s he doing well? Oh no, it\\'s going to be a very short night. Then they say Donald Trump is the projected winner by a lot. They say, well, what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men, diplomas. He did well with African American community. By the way, we are doing really well with the African American community, with the Hispanic community. We\\'re doing well with women. We\\'re doing very well. We\\'re doing well with suburbia, suburbia. I ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia. If Biden got in, they will destroy the suburbia. We call it suburbia of the world and we love it. I know it well, Westchester County, the suburban, they sometimes, if you say suburban housewife, you\\'re in deep trouble. So what you do is you say suburban women, they love me. You know why? They want security and they don\\'t want projects being right next to their house. That\\'s okay. They don\\'t want it. By the way, that includes minorities. Because 29% to 30% of these suburban communities are minorities. That includes them. They don\\'t want that. They want safe communities. They want great communities. They don\\'t want to lose the American dream. It\\'s very simple. I got rid of the regulation from Obama- Biden that was destroying suburbia. Okay? Destroying it. I think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in, you know who\\'s in charge? You know who\\'s in charge of the program? Cory Booker, Cory Booker. Cory Booker. So, I think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody, you better get smart because you\\'re not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in. If I get in, you\\'ve got it. You\\'ve also got your second amendment if I get it. In 2018, we expanded the Senate majority. Remember, they said, first of all, I wasn\\'t running. I wasn\\'t running. It makes a difference. Wait you see what happens. We\\'re going to take back the house. We\\'re going to get rid of this crazy Nancy Pelosi. Kevin McCarthy\\'s done a great job. We\\'re going to take back the house. People are so tired of her. People are so tired. Did you hear today? The latest. So, they impeached me for perfect phone call. Perfect. It was a perfect phone call. Now they want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as I\\'m constitutionally obligated to do, to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Go ahead and I want them to do that. I want them to do that. We will. We will. We will. If he puts forth a highly qualified candidate, we will impeach him. Well, I said, \"Well, I\\'m the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the Supreme.\" So, we\\'re going to put up our nominee who\\'s going to be outstanding. We\\'re looking at five incredible jurists, five incredible people, women that are extraordinary in every way. I mean, honestly, it could be anyone. I mean, we\\'re going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday. Again, they say it\\'s the most important thing and think of it. So in a single term, single term, by the end of our term, we will have nominated and had confirmed I think it\\'ll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three Supreme Court justices. Think of that. Three. Some presidents, they never get any. They last a long time, a lot of presidents get none. We\\'ve had three. It\\'s blowing their minds. It\\'s blowing their minds, but for the people of Ohio, this is what you want. So, it looks like we\\'re going to have three and it\\'s going to be very exciting. It\\'s exciting even from me. I\\'m going to look forward to it. Probably Saturday, we will announce the nominee and it\\'s somebody that you\\'re going to have great respect for, great respect. Thank you. Big stuff. That\\'s a big thing. They set the course of our country for many years to come, whether it\\'s on life or the second amendment or so many other things, they set the whole course of the country. Very important position, the most important. Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they\\'re too extreme to withstand any form of public review. If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition. They will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box. So, they don\\'t want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals. If he does something even towards left of center, which would be acceptable, I guess, we have no choice. If he did that, he would lose the left. So, he\\'s going to have to put in radicals. So he doesn\\'t want to show who his judges are. I\\'ve shown a list, I have a double list, about 45 from which I will only pick, but he doesn\\'t want to do that, because if you found out who he was going to pick, he would be unelectable. Hopefully, he\\'s going to be unelectable anyway. We\\'re going to find out. So, he wouldn\\'t be able to survive a Joe Biden. You wouldn\\'t be able to survive. We\\'ve been calling it socialism. I don\\'t think it\\'s socialism. I think it\\'s a step beyond what they\\'re talking about. You look at Portland, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland. These are Democrat run cities that are horrible in crime. There\\'s no law and order, no cash bail, no anything. You know what? The Republican cities are running great. They\\'re running great. So, we\\'re going to get it all changed around. We went into Minneapolis, we solved the problem like you wouldn\\'t believe. What did it take? You saw it. What did that take? I would say probably 30 minutes. Right? They should have called us in about seven days earlier. How about the reporter? He gets up there, behind him is a burning city. I never saw anything like it. He\\'s saying, \"There are really no protests here. This is very friendly.\" We call this a friendly protester because you\\'re not supposed to have political rallies. You\\'re not supposed to have anything. The only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores, looting, doing what … That\\'s okay, because that\\'s protesting, but we\\'ll call this a friendly protest, but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come- … future the damage we\\'ll endure for generations to come. We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion. And a lot of that\\'s got to do with the fact that we\\'re going to have one extra, but we didn\\'t think this was going to happen. But I used to say just a week ago, \"We\\'re going to have one, two, three, four, and maybe even five, the next President, and the Supreme Court is going to be a tremendous factor.\" A lot of people said that\\'s the reason I won so easily in the Electoral College last time. 306, 306 to 223. \"He will not get to 270.\" Remember? \"He will not get to 270. This will be a short evening for Donald Trump. Oh, good riddance. Thank God we got rid of him. Oh, this is going to be great.\" And then that problem happened. \"Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio.\" Remember the one, she was crying? She was crying. \"Donald Trump has won Ohio.\" But it wasn\\'t winning Ohio, it was by the margin. \"Where the hell?\" he said, \"Where did this margin come from?\" They opened the polls. Then they closed the polls. Normally you have to wait hours, unless it\\'s a total runaway. And they said, \"Ah, the polls and the doors are closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won.\" And they go, \"Oh my God. But wait a minute. He won by nine points. What the hell\\'s going on over here?\" Then they said, \"Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia. Donald Trump has won North Carolina, South Carolina.\" Remember that? Was that the most exciting evening, really? Remember? And it\\'s not Donald Trump. It\\'s you. It\\'s all of us. They use the name Donald Trump. It\\'s all of us have won. And this one\\'s going to be even better because nobody has done, and then don\\'t even challenge it, the fake news, nobody has done in three and a half years what we\\'ve done. We\\'ve rebuilt our military. Two and a half trillion dollars. We\\'ve taken care of our vets. We have choice, we have accountability. We can fire people now when they\\'re not treating our vets right. We couldn\\'t do that before. They could treat our vets terribly. We have accountability. Nobody has done what we\\'ve done for our vets. 91% approval rating at the VA. 91%, the highest ever. So nobody\\'s done it, and that\\'s why I think this is going to be the most important of all. I used to say, \"Well, I don\\'t know. How does it compare to 2016?\" I just gave that up. This is the most important election. You know why? Two reasons. Number one, that\\'s over with, the hell with it. The hell with it. But the truth is it\\'s got a seat in, and we have a lot of new things including additional, substantial, middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts, and tremendous regulation cuts. And we\\'re finishing up with our military. We\\'re building Space Force. The wall is going incredibly. You remember the wall? They don\\'t talk about the wall anymore, the fake news. Once we started building it, if you think that was easy to build the wall, we had an entire party that would die for the fact, and I made a terrible mistake in the wall, instead of telling you, \"We\\'re going to build a wall, we\\'re going to build a wall,\" the Democrats formed, it was very tough, but I got it. I\\'m a real estate developer. You can always get money. You learn we have a lot of little pockets. We had a lot of big pockets. But the military was great. The Army Corps of Engineers were great. So we\\'re up to 330 miles of wall. We\\'re doing 10 miles a week, and we\\'re going to be finished with the wall very soon. And it\\'s exactly the wall, the little more expensive wall, they want like nice, expensive, but exactly what border patrol wanted. We\\'re building them the exact wall that they want. We can\\'t give them any excuses. We can\\'t give them any excuses. But it\\'s true, they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought I\\'d be able to get a bill. Once I got it going, got it built, I got the financing, we won a lot of lawsuits, by the way, we won a lot of lawsuits. They sued us. Pelosi was suing us. Congress was suing us. The Senate was suing us. We won a lot of lawsuits. Once it was obvious that we won and we started building, they never talk about the wall anymore. And I made a terrible, terrible mistake because I had to work my ass off to get that thing built. You have no idea. You have no idea. You have no idea. But I should have said, the mistake, I should have said when I talked to these big crowds, and the crowds are getting bigger, there\\'s more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago, but I should have said, instead of, \"We will build a wall,\" I kept, \"We will build a wall,\" place would go crazy, I should have said, \"We will not build the wall. Under no circumstances, will we build a wall,\" the Democrats would have given us all the money we wanted. It\\'s true. It\\'s true. And then they would have said, \"See, he didn\\'t keep his campaign promise.\" These people are sick. The Biden nominated justices will shred our Second Amendment, eliminate the right to self defense, and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms. You know that. Put in other language, they will end your Second Amendment. And they will do that. By the way, if I wasn\\'t here, you wouldn\\'t have a Second Amendment right now. That would be gone. I hate to say it. I\\'m the only thing standing between you and chaos, I\\'m telling you. And Second Amendment and all of the other things. Biden\\'s justices will remove the words \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance. Did you see that? Did you see it? They said, \"No, we\\'d never remove. And I saw it, they\\'re doing the Pledge of Allegiance. And I said, \"Oh, it must be a typo.\" They left the words \"under God\" out of the Pledge of Allegiance, the Democrats. And I said, \"Oh, there\\'s a typo. Typo, they made a mistake. What a stupid mistake. Can you believe it? That guy\\'s in big trouble. What a stupid mistake.\" And then I heard it a second time. They did the same mistake. That\\'s what they\\'re doing. They\\'re going to take God out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. That\\'s never happening. It\\'s never happening. A lot of these Democrats states, you see it, the churches are closed. They don\\'t want our churches to open. You can have a riot where you kill people in the streets. 25,000 people don\\'t have to wear a mask, nothing. They can march down the streets, step on each other\\'s face, they can do whatever the hell they want, that\\'s okay. But you can\\'t go to church. They have ideas, they have plans, and it\\'s never happening with me as your President. That I can tell you. And you see it, they want to tear down crosses from public spaces. You see it. Since I signed a little law, they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago, and I said, \"Do we have any laws, like old laws when they was strong, when we were smart, when we were tough?\" \"Sir, we have one, sir.\" A General came in. \"What\\'s the law, General?\" \"Sir, there was a law from quite a while ago, 10 years in prison.\" They didn\\'t use the word jail, prison. Prison\\'s a tougher word. I said, \"What do you mean, 10 years?\" \"You get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument.\" I said, \"General, let me see that sucker, please. Bring that to my office.\" And we revived it because you can\\'t get that approved by Congress. They would never. Today in Congress, you\\'d do it, they\\'ll give you half a day in a hotel someplace. So 10 years. So they were having a big march on Washington in two days and I signed this new law. We updated it, and it was 10 years. You get 10 years in prison. You touch, you knock down a monument. And there\\'s no games. This is the old days. This is the days when we had strong laws, when we had real laws, when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws. So here\\'s the thing. So they weren\\'t going to come in, they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named Thomas Jefferson. That\\'s not too good. They had obliterated a lot of different things. And so I had a news conference. I announced that I\\'m signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail. And the police in Washington, and we had National Guard, we had Secret Service. We were all ready for them. We were ready for them. And the time came, there\\'s was only a problem, nobody showed up. You know why? 10 years was too much. 10 years was too much. It\\'s amazing the way. Isn\\'t it amazing the way it all works? So instead they burned down Portland. I speak to the Governor. The mayor is hopeless. He\\'s a hopeless, poor guy. They chased him out of his apartment, and he still thinks they\\'re wonderful people. They\\'re burning down his city. But I want to go in there with the National Guard so bad. It would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem. When they heard in Seattle that we were going in, we were going in the next day, the guys just walked away. They left. That was the end of it. We had nothing to do. But they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. Biden\\'s justices will erase national borders, they don\\'t want borders, protect sanctuary cities, and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals. And if you look at some of these jihadist nations, no thank you. Somebody said, \"That\\'s not nice. That\\'s not politically correct.\" I said, \"That\\'s okay.\" They\\'ll clip all the police departments, free violent criminals, shield foreign terrorists, and declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children. That\\'s what they want. They don\\'t want any death penalty. Not for the Boston Bomber, not for anybody. You see the Boston Bomber, they\\'re still trying this guy, what he did to so many lives. He killed people, ruined so many families, ruined so many lives. And by the way, they want the Boston Bomber to be able to vote. You know that. In three and a half years under my administration, we\\'ve secured America\\'s borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio. I love Ohio. I love Ohio. I don\\'t know what it is. I was told by Bob and some of the Congressmen that are here, we have some great ones, I\\'m going to introduce them in a second, but I was told that they\\'re not even trying for Ohio. You know why? Because I love you and you love me, and that\\'s the way it is. That\\'s the way it is. Thank you. I love you too. It\\'s very interesting. So somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there\\'s crazy chances going on. They have too about the seat and all that. But there was another chant that\\'s happening at all these rallies. We\\'re having massive rallies. We\\'re in Minnesota. We had a tremendous crowd. Wisconsin, tremendous. Pennsylvania, every one of them. I mean, in all fairness, it\\'s like this, everyone. But this rant is going on like it\\'s crazy. And it\\'s, \"We love you. We love you. We love you,\" and you know what? I don\\'t want to say it. I\\'m just saying, they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation, even we loved Ronald Reagan, but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said, \"We love you,\" about, I guess I have to call myself a politician. I don\\'t feel like a politician. How nice is that? I never heard it. I\\'ve been to a lot of different speeches and rallies. I\\'ve never heard crowds go, \"We love you.\" But you know why? We love you. I love you. But you know why? Because, again, nobody has done what we\\'ve done. Ohio had the best year in its history last year. We had a great year. And next year, assuming we win, which I hope we\\'re going to win, but if we win, you\\'re going to have a year next year. First of all, take a look at the third quarter. It\\'s going to be announced the numbers just before the election. They\\'ll come out three days before the election. And I\\'ll tell you what, I\\'ll bet on the numbers, even though Crazy Nancy and these people don\\'t want to give any stimulus, they don\\'t want to give anything. They want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can. You know what they\\'re going to do? They\\'re going to announce they\\'re going to be opening on November 4th. There\\'ll be open. All these closed states, they\\'re going to be open on November 4th. One of them blue and a teacher\\'s union. Did you see it? \"No, we don\\'t want to open now. We don\\'t want to open. The pandemic. We don\\'t want to.\" We\\'re rounding the turn on the pandemic. Vaccines are coming soon. \"But we don\\'t want to open. Around November 4th we\\'re going to open.\" This person that\\'s a judge of a union said that. That was not good. I think they\\'ll get rid of her quickly. I\\'m also proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. You better have a good year after all of that. You have a good team, right? Good coach. Good team. Good everything. You have a good team. You always have a good team. But there was a case, what do I know? I said, \"How\\'s it going? Everything good? Are you struggling?\" They said, \"Sir, Sleepy Joe Biden did an ad that you,\" me, \"that you closed football.\" I said, \"What do you mean I closed? I didn\\'t close.\" The guy did an ad. It\\'s called disinformation. It\\'s called the opposite of what the fact is. Not only didn\\'t I close it, I didn\\'t think about it too much, okay? The states should all be open. But I heard about Big 10 football, and because of this ad, I said, \"Hey, wait a minute. I have an idea.\" It was a fake ad, just like the ad on the grave sites, and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent. He has no idea. Because now, see, I would never talk like that, but when I saw that horrible thing, and nobody\\'s done more for the military than I have, when I saw that horrible ad, \"An anonymous source has said that Donald Trump said this,\" I have 28 people now that have come forward saying it\\'s a total lie, they don\\'t care, so they did an ad, once they did that, I said, \"Well, now the gloves are off.\" Let\\'s face it, Joe Biden is incompetent. He always was even in prime time. he was incompetent in prime time. And now he\\'s really incompetent. But because of the ad, I said, \"It\\'s very interesting, that ad, it\\'s very interesting. Let me call up the Commissioner.\" I had called up the Commissioner, very good guy, and I said, \"Commissioner, what can we do to get Big 10 football back?\" \"Well, I don\\'t know.\" And we started a little thing, the Commissioner and myself, one of my guys, he\\'s fantastic, and within a few days, it started getting talked about, and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world. We get no credit for it. We\\'ve tested almost 100 million people. India is second with 38th and they have 1.5 billion people, slightly more than you. But I will tell you, so all of a sudden they have schools. Then looked like it was going to open without Michigan and without a couple of states. And then all of a sudden the pressure became so great, and the full league is opening now and it\\'s going to be very exciting. And I will tell you, it\\'s not a question of taking credit, but truly we were the ones that did that. I mean, it was. I\\'ll tell you when I do it and when I don\\'t. But it was closed, it was gone, it was announced that it was closed. And what really spurred me on was when Sleepy Joe announced that I was the one that did it. I said, \"I didn\\'t even know it was closed.\" But once I found out it was, I called the Commissioner. He was really good, I tell you. And we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going. It looked like we had seven schools, eight schools. All of a sudden, everybody fell into line. I think they\\'re all open now. Every one of them is participating. So I want to thank the Commissioner. I want to thank all of those schools. May the best team win. In other words, Ohio State. That\\'s a good team. You know who the best proponents were? The players and especially the parents of the players. These kids have a short window to get into the NFL to create some excitement and how good they are. And you have a lot of potential players, but they couldn\\'t play football. And they said, \"We\\'re safer on the field than we are staying at home,\" and they meant it. And we did something and I\\'m happy about it. So enjoy the football, enjoy it. Under 16 years of Presidents Obama and Bush, median household income rose only $2,945. So remember that. That\\'s 16 years, 2009, so let\\'s say 3000. Under three years of President Trump, it rose almost $7,000. So think of that, 16 years. Three years, achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any President in the history of our country. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again. We\\'re building it again. I see the signs \"Make America Great Again,\" so I say this, it\\'s called now \"Make America Great Again. Again\". Because we did it and then we had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. If we didn\\'t do that, you would have had three million people. It would have been terrible. It\\'s terrible anyway. They shouldn\\'t have allowed it to happen, China. To defeat the China Virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War Two. Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate- Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. That\\'s remdesivir and all of the things, the plasma, all different things. Where do you see what\\'s coming out? Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. That\\'s before today\\'s big breakout. You know they had a big breakout in Europe and they keep saying in the fake news, they keep saying about, \"Oh, Europe, Europe, Europe.\" Well, we\\'re doing better than Europe. I hate to see what happened, and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing. But they had a big hit and they\\'ll take care of it. They know how to do it. They\\'ll take care of it. We\\'re working very closely with Europe and other countries, including on the vaccine. We have three vaccines right now that are right there. They\\'re right at the starting gate and they\\'re going to be fantastic. So it\\'s good. With Biden, if you had that regime, you\\'d be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the FDA. What we\\'ve done in a very safe manner is amazing. Now remember this, Biden was in charge of the swine flu, right? It\\'s called the H1N1. Remember he calls it the N1H1. I said, \"No, no, no, no.\" H comes before the N. It\\'s so easy. But he goes, \"The N1H1.\" We say, \"No.\" But it\\'s the swine flu. Maybe we just call it the swine flu. He did such a gross, horrible job on that. His own man who was in charge of it said they didn\\'t have a clue. They didn\\'t know what they were doing. It was a much less lethal disease and they lost many, many people. Many, many people. It was totally incompetently. And now I got this guy standing up. Well, we\\'re giving him advice. His own guy that ran it. Did everybody see this? They\\'re saying they didn\\'t have a clue what they were doing. It was so bad. I don\\'t know why the hell he said it, to be honest with you. Who would say that? Maybe because he was honest. Does that make sense? Now Biden gets up and he\\'s saying to do the same things as we\\'ve already done. He basically took our plan and he said, \"This is what you should do.\" But we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any Western nation by far. Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.9 million jobs in the state of Ohio. You know that? He knows it. He\\'s got one of them. He\\'s got one of them. Through operation warp speed, we\\'re developing these great vaccines. And that\\'s going to be… Literally, these will be done in record time. Like nobody\\'s ever done it before. On November 3rd, Ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine, shut down the country. He actually suggested that he would shut down the country. We now know the disease. We didn\\'t know it. Now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, that\\'s what it really affects. That\\'s it. You know, in some States, thousands of people, nobody young below the age of 18, like nobody. They have a strong immune system. Who knows? Take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system, but it affects virtually nobody. It\\'s an amazing thing. By the way, open your schools. Everybody open your schools. Sleepy Joe Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax site, ban American energy, destroy the suburbs, give free healthcare to illegal aliens. How about that one? You know the bad part about that? We all have heart. We want to take care of people. Probably that is everybody\\'s going to come to the United States. People that weren\\'t even thinking about it, they\\'re going to say, \"Oh man, these idiots are giving free healthcare, free college education. They\\'re giving free everything. They\\'re giving a Rolls Royce to every family that enters through the Southern border.\" Remember I said that jokingly and CNN said, \"He misrepresented. They are not getting a Rolls Royce.\" I agree. Now they\\'re sick. They are sick. And indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. They\\'re doing that. We\\'re stopping it. To combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we\\'re launching a pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time. We got to. No party can lead America that will not teach our children to love America. Biden\\'s running mate, Kamilla. Who likes Kamilla? Does anybody like her? She was the most failed candidate. I mean, she started off good. And every week she went down, down 15 points, 12 points, 11 points, 9 points, six points, five points, four points, two points. Didn\\'t she leave at about two or one? She was heading down to the basement. She was so mean to him. I felt sorry for him. No, I did. I felt sorry. So she called them everything from a racist to a MeTooer. He was MeToo. He was a part of the MeToo generation. What she called him, what she said. So I brilliantly said, \"Well, he can\\'t pick Pocahontas because she was too nasty. How nasty was she to Bloomberg? Was she unbelievable? Boy, he was standing there. What happened? What happened? No, actually. What happened? Mini Mike. He\\'s another beauty. He\\'s a real beauty. Mini Mike, what happened? What the hell happened? He hit her so hard. Remember? She hits him with about 30 different things, and I\\'m not talking about our president. He thought she was talking about me. Can you believe it? And I\\'m not talking. I\\'m talking about you. He said, \"Get me out of here. Get me out of here.\" And now he wants to buy his way back into the Democrat party. He wants to buy his way back into the Democrats. He hasn\\'t taken enough abuse. If I were him, I\\'d sort of either ride it out or stay with the good Trump economy and get even richer. Biden\\'s running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail. You saw that? Including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child. Now they\\'re trying to free them on bail. They\\'re putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist. And that\\'s what it is. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist, and that\\'s what we\\'re doing for many people in jail. Many people. Remember what I told you about the monuments? This is remembrance. Isn\\'t it beautiful? We don\\'t see that anymore. Have you seen a monument knocked down recently? No, we don\\'t see it anymore. I don\\'t know. We want to rip down Abraham Lincoln. It got to Lincoln. First, it was not too many people heard of him. Confederate soldiers, et cetera. You say, \"Hey, look, do it through a process.\" But they started hitting Lincoln. Then they hit Gandhi. Now Gandhi was about peace. Gandhi just wanted peace. Leave me alone. Peace, peace, peace. Let\\'s rip them down. They\\'re sick people. The Democrat party\\'s war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in Democrat control cities costing countless black lives. If Biden and the left gain power, they will dismantle police departments nationwide. I\\'ll tell you, the community that\\'s most hurt, most hurt by what they\\'re doing and there is the black community, the Hispanic community. And we\\'re doing great in the polls with the black community and the Hispanic community. And the Asian community. We\\'re doing great. In fact, we did so well last night on one poll, they said it must be a typo. They did. It must be an error. It wasn\\'t. It\\'s no error. You\\'re going to find out on November 3rd it\\'s no error. As president, I always stand and I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. They\\'re great people. They\\'re very brave people. Not easy, and they don\\'t get support. We have to give them back their dignity. We have to let them do their job. That\\'s very simple. They\\'re great. We\\'re joined tonight by two high school football players. They became very, very famous. They became more famous than President Trump. They were beautiful. I watched them running through the crowds with those flags. Here\\'s some place, I don\\'t know, you got a lot of people here. We\\'re going to try and figure it out. Hold up your flag. Jared Bentley and Brady Williams, who were recently suspended from their high school football team after displaying flags in support of our police and first responders on the anniversary of September 11th attacks. Where are they? Come up here, fellas. Come up. Come up here. Come up here. Secret Service is thrilled about this. See, these young kids can hop over the fence like it\\'s nothing. Come up here. They\\'re good looking kids. I want to congratulate you. You become famous. They\\'re going to go to Hollywood. They\\'re going to become movie actors right now. Right? You feel good about it? How\\'s your team doing? How\\'s your team? How\\'s it doing? He said it could be better. You know what? You\\'re doing great. And everybody out here loves you and they appreciate you. You did a great job. Good job, fella. Good job. Good luck. Is your arm okay? Good. You all right? Good. Good guys. Good guys. Jared and Brady, thank you for supporting the heroes in our law enforcement. We all love you. I\\'m telling you. You really set something up that\\'s incredible, and thank your parents for letting you do it. I watched. You ask your parents approval. Isn\\'t that nice? You know what the father said? \"You better do it.\" Right? That\\'s great. Thank you very much, fellas. Great job. Really great job. Country has a lot of respect. Speaking about warriors, we\\'re also joined tonight by some great, great congressmen who are warriors and they represent Ohio so well and they love you and they love our country. Representative Bob Latta. Thank you, Bob. Great job. They like you, Bob. That\\'s very good. Good job, Bob. Thank you very much. Congressman Warren Davidson. You know Warren. Thank you, Warren. Great job, Warren. Congressman Mike Turner. A great lawyer, actually. Thank you, Mike. Great job, Mike. You\\'re really great. Ohio treasurer Robert Sprague. Robert, thank you. Thanks. Good treasurer. Ohio auditor Keith Faber. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Keith. Ohio House speaker, Bob Cupp. Where is he? Thank you, Bob. Great job. Ohio Senate president, Larry Obhof. Thank you. Thank you, Larry Obhof. Larry is a good man. How\\'s it going, Larry? Good. You\\'re doing a good job. Huh? You\\'re doing good. How are we doing, Larry? Is it going good? You\\'re right about that. You\\'re doing a great job. Thanks, Larry. I appreciate it. Ohio GOP chairman Jane Timken. She\\'s unbelievable. Thank you, Jane. How are we doing, Jane? How\\'s it going? How does it compare to four years ago, Jane? Up higher. All right. Good. Good. I think we are. I think we are. A friend of mine that I\\'ll tell you, this is the greatest optimist. When I thought we had to be down, we lost a lot of the top, top support. The head of the Republican party, little things like that. I said, \"We don\\'t have a head of the Republican party. He left because you had a terrible governor in this state.\" Terrible. Your previous governor was terrible. He was terrible. I\\'ll tell you, I got this man. I didn\\'t know him. Within about a week, I said, \"Man, this guy\\'s a big optimist.\" And he was right. He called it right to the thing. He ran my campaign. When he came back for the second time, we had him in a high position. I said, \"Bob, I think you\\'re great. You\\'re doing a great job. I want you back in Ohio. We have to do it again.\" Bob Paduchik. Where\\'s Bob? Thank you. Thank you, Bob. Get over here, Bob. Thank you, Bob. He wants no glamor. He wants no glory. He just wants to win. He called it right down to the bone. We had a rough couple of days. I said, \"Bob, how we doing?\" \"You went up two points.\" I said, \"You got to be kidding.\" But we did. So much evolves around Ohio and it\\'s just a state that we have a relationship with. It\\'s a great state. We\\'ve done a great job for you and you\\'ve done a great job for us. So we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Together, we\\'ve spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the Democrats and Joe Biden over a 47 year period. Think of it. He\\'s always talking about, \"You should have done this. You should have done that.\" He really just left office. It\\'s not that long ago, right? He\\'s been there for years and years and now he should have done. He\\'s never going to do anything. He\\'s never going to do anything. Guy is a stone cold loser. Biden supported every globalist sellout of Ohio workers for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China\\'s entry into the World Trade Organization, the disaster known as TPP and how about the Paris Climate Accord? That\\'s another beauty. I\\'ll tell you, that was designed to hurt our country. You would have lost trillions of dollars, closed your factories all over the place. In the meantime, China didn\\'t kick in for another 10 years. The whole thing was a rigged deal. I tell you, I said, \"I\\'m going to get killed for this one, but we\\'re going to terminate.\" And you know what? The people got it right away. Everybody understood. That was another rip off of our country. This state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. Joe Biden is a shameless phony who pretends… He doesn\\'t have a clue. What the hell? We\\'re talking like he knows. He\\'s got guys around him that are pretty smart. They\\'re radical left. He\\'s going to do whatever they tell him to do. He pretends to care about blue collar workers. After spending more than five decades in Washington, he tells me, \"Why didn\\'t you do this? Why didn\\'t you do that?\" You see these fake commercials. \"Why didn\\'t you do it?\" I said, \"I\\'ve only been here three and a half years. This guy has been here for 47 years. He didn\\'t do anything.\" My actions saved countless jobs across Ohio and here in Toledo, the home of the Jeep, right? The home of the Jeep. That\\'s good. That\\'s a great brand. They\\'ve done a great job with Jeep. Jeep. Everyone loves Jeep. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to Ohio when we ended the NAFTA nightmare. I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July. That\\'s a big difference. Like day and night. It\\'s working out great too. It\\'s working out great. You know how I know that it\\'s a good deal for us? Because they don\\'t like it. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China\\'s rampant theft of Ohio jobs. We achieved American energy. We passed record tax cuts and regulations. Our energy independence is incredible. We have now energy independence. We don\\'t have to be in these far away lands anymore. Now we\\'ll be there to help certain allies that have been great, but we don\\'t have to be. Since my election, natural gas production in Ohio has surged 63%. They want to close it up. By the way, you do know they want to close it up. They want to close up all fracking natural gas ever. They want to close it up. This would kill at least 700,000 Ohio jobs. Probably more than a million. While I\\'m president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and Ohio workers will continue leading the way. I just left the great state of Texas, and I talked to a lot of people like this, a great crowd of people. We have tremendous support all over the country. I\\'ll tell you what. These people are great. And here\\'s the platform that they have. Sleepy Joe Biden. No oil, no religion, no God, and no guns. Now I\\'m in Texas. It\\'s a really rough thing in Ohio, but now we\\'re talking Texas. No oil, that doesn\\'t work well in Texas, right? No guns. That doesn\\'t work well in Texas. No God. Look what they\\'re doing to the churches and everything. That doesn\\'t work. No God. No religion. That doesn\\'t work well. You would have to be George Washington with your running mate would be Abraham Lincoln. Okay. Your VP candidate. And you\\'d still lose very big. And then they say- … and you\\'d still lose very big. And then they say, \"Yeah, he\\'s doing okay. He\\'s two up in Texas.\" They said it last time too, that Texas is even, four years ago. And everybody said, \"No, I think Trump is killing it.\" We\\'d have stadiums with 25,000, 30,000 people, much more that couldn\\'t get in. We\\'d have 40,000, 50,000 people outside and they\\'d say I was even. We won in a landslide, just like we won this state, in a landslide. You know the expression they use, \"Texas is in play.\" You know what \"in play\" means? It could go either way. And guys would get on there and say, \"I don\\'t think so.\" And then that night again, \"The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas.\" I mean, the whole thing is crazy. It\\'s crazy, it\\'s crazy. You know what they do? It\\'s suppression polls. They try and depress you. They try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife, your husband, you go out to dinner, \"Darling, let\\'s have dinner. It\\'s so sad. We love Donald, but he just can\\'t make it. He can\\'t make it. Let\\'s go out, have dinner. We\\'ll come home and watch the results.\" Except 2016 came and nobody did that, they all went out and voted and we kicked ass. Tell me, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? Did you ever see the ratings, the combined ratings? I think the biggest ever. But was that the most exciting? 2016, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, including more than $6 billion in contracts. I\\'ll tell you what, you like the word pronounced Lima or Lima, because I saved Lima. And I tell you what, I saved Lima. I came here and they were going to close that plant in Lima. They were going to close the tank plant. It was done. And I said, \"Why are we closing a tank plant?\" And I got a couple of calls from my friends, the Congressman right here. And I got calls. And Jim Jordan called me. Do you like Jim Jordan? He\\'s great. And I looked at this army tank plant in Lima. I said, \"Why are we closing it?\" And I saw the people building the tanks and the technology\\'s incredible. And if you ever closed it, you\\'d never be able to open a thing like that again. So I overrode the generals, I overrode everybody, and now we\\'re making a record number of tanks in that plant and it\\'s absolutely thriving. But we had tremendous success. We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the world\\'s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many other people. Qasem Soleimani is dead. He\\'s dead. I withdrew from last administration\\'s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. They paid $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash. You know they got? Nothing. They got nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president for many, many decades said they were going to do it. They never did it. They never did it. They didn\\'t have the guts to do it. They campaigned on it, they were all going to do it. Then they got there, there was a lot of pressure put on them. A lot of pressure put on me. Every leader was calling all over. \"Please don\\'t do it. Please don\\'t do it. Mr. President, please don\\'t do it. Don\\'t do it. Don\\'t move it. Just leave it the way it is. It\\'s okay.\" But I promised and I said, \"I\\'m going to do it.\" And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world. Kings, I got calls from presidents, from prime ministers, \"Please, please don\\'t tell it.\" Then I got calls, \"Please have him call me back me,\" me. I said, \"Look, tell everybody I\\'m out for three days. I\\'m not going to be able to call them back.\" I had a news conference, we announced it. Then I called everybody back. \"Hey, how you doing? How\\'s everything going? Everything going good?\" \"Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but it\\'s too late. You already did it.\" And we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done. And it\\'s something we had to do. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East. And you saw that. And I\\'m the only man that got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and I didn\\'t get any press. They wouldn\\'t. For two of them. Last week, I\\'m not bragging about it, I\\'m just saying, I\\'m the President of the United States because of Kosovo-Serbia, they\\'ve been killing each other for years, I worked out a deal for them. I got nominated. And then Israel with Bahrain and UAE, and many more to come. I mean, they all want to do it. We\\'ll have peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. No blood. We\\'re going to have peace in the Middle East. So I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And I told this story last night. Should I tell it or not? Should I? Yes. She wants me to do it. So I go home to our great First Lady. I said, \"First Lady, you\\'re going to be so proud of me tonight. I was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people.\" Great people. \"First lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\" I was like this. \"I was nominated.\" It\\'s a big deal for our country, right? And she said, \"Oh, that\\'s good.\" I said, \"Let\\'s turn on the evening news. Let\\'s watch it. This is going to be a big show tonight. Get ready.\" And NBC, which is one of the most crooked, one of the worst newscasts, and I\\'m talking about normal NBC, not MSDNC. MSDNC is the worst. So I turned on NBC with Lester Holt, another beauty. And they start with a hurricane and then they went to something, and something else. And I\\'m saying, \"First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing. We\\'re 20 minutes into a half hour show. They haven\\'t mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize.\" And then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned. Then I got nominated for a second one. They never mentioned. And when Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, now when Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, he didn\\'t know why he was nominated. It was like right at the very beginning. He didn\\'t do anything. He did nothing and he got nominated. It was the biggest story I\\'ve ever seen. But that\\'s okay. In the meantime, we\\'re President and they\\'re not. No, that\\'s right. You would think if you nominated for the Nobel Prize, you\\'d get maybe half a second. The First Lady, she said, \"Sorry, darling. That\\'s the way it goes, isn\\'t it?\" Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War disaster. He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for our country. \"Oh, it\\'s really great.\" If it were up to Sleepy Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would be alive today, ISIS would be on a rampage, Iran would control the Middle East, and China would be the dominant power anywhere in the world. And I want to tell you, if you go back a few months before this pandemic, we were gaining, gaining, gaining. We had an insurmountable lead on China. I always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years. We were so far beyond, we were doing much better than they were. The Biden agenda would obliterate our economy. He destroyed social security, destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions. That\\'s what he\\'s going to do, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. He would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by, listen to this, over 700%. And this is the manifesto with Bernie Sanders, with Crazy Bernie. He made this deal with Crazy Bernie. And by the way, a lot of the Crazy Bernie voters last time, four years ago, voted for Trump because of trade, because the one thing they do understand, that our country has been off for years. Biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Very important to have them. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. They\\'re totally against it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just, in conclusion, first of all, it\\'s been a great honor to be with you. This is, really, it\\'s a great state. They\\'re great people. I really mean it. No, I really mean it. Get out there on November 3rd. We\\'ve got to win this one big. This is a bad, bad ideology. This is probably a step beyond socialism. I really think in many ways, it\\'s communism we\\'re talking about. This is a step beyond. Socialism\\'s no good. Communism\\'s really bad. But get out there on November 3rd and let\\'s show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us. So, in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance, this ridiculous, crazy reliance on China, and all of these far away lands once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police. And by the way, thank you, police. Thank you, law enforcement. Increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, stupid, endless, foreign wars. We will maintain America\\'s unrivaled military. Our military might has never been like it is right now because of what we\\'ve done. And we had no choice, and hope to God we never have to use it, because if you would ever see the power of what we\\'ve done over the last three years, it\\'s almost better for you not to see it. We are the envy of every power, every country in the world. We have weapons that nobody ever even thought possible. And just as I said, hope to God we never have to use them. And the way we don\\'t have to use them is to keep that kind of strength. Nobody\\'s going to be talking to us. We\\'re going to have peace through strength, and it\\'s all made in the U.S.A. Made in the U.S.A. We\\'ll end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I\\'ve already signed it into law. Kicks in on January 1st. It\\'s going to cut your bills down to a level that you wouldn\\'t believe. That doesn\\'t mean the drug companies and the hospital and corporations are happy with me. But that\\'s okay. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50%, 60% and 70%. Big pharma does not like me too much. They\\'re taking ads about me that are so bad, but you get it, you understand it. They\\'re not too thrilled with me, including the rebates. The rebates go back to you. The rebates before went back to very rich people. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That\\'s what\\'s happening. NASA is again the leading space station anywhere in the world. There\\'s nothing like a space center, what we\\'ve done. And there was grass growing in the runways when I took over three and a half years ago. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, \"In God we trust.\" For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Ohio. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get everybody, and get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. And in your state, in Ohio, early voting has already begun and don\\'t wait. And when you see them cheating on the other side, I don\\'t say if, when, when you see them cheating with those ballots, all of those unsolicited ballots, those millions of ballots, you\\'ll see them, anytime you do, report them to the authorities. The authorities awaiting and watching. From Akron to Columbus, from Cincinnati to Queen City, I know it weller than Cleveland, and from Dayton to Toledo, we inherit the legacy of generations of Ohio patriots, like Neil Armstrong, Annie Oakley, William McKinley, and the amazing Ulysses S. Grant, that\\'s good. Nobody\\'s stock has gone up like Grant. Nobody in the last 10 years. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you haven\\'t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Ohio, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Get out and vote. Thank you.\\n Thank you very much, Phoenix. We love to be back. We\\'ll be back a lot. We\\'re going to win that election. Thank you very much. Hello, Phoenix. It\\'s great being here in the great state of Arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And with your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Arizona in a landslide. It\\'s all over TV that the folks here tonight have helped a great World War II veteran into the arena. I don\\'t know if he knows it, but he\\'s right now the hottest celebrity in the world. I don\\'t know what\\'s going on here. He might even be hotter than Trump right now, I have to say. Did you see the scene? No, he\\'s all over television. Even fake news CNN him on. They say he\\'s a legitimate great hero of World War II. Erwin Julian. Irvin, thank you. And I asked my son Don to get a couple of hats and get some things, and give them to Erwin right now. And I want to thank you. Really, that\\'s a great honor. And thank you for the great job you\\'ve done. An American Patriot. Thank you very much. Thank you, Don. How did Don do tonight? Okay? He\\'s good. Good guy. And he loves this country. So this is truly an incredible time for America. We have the best economy, the most prosperous country that we\\'ve ever had, and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far. Do you remember the good time we had a week ago at the State of the Union? You remember that, right? And that was my honor. But I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before. And after three years, of very unfair and ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades… It was the radical left\\'s pathetic attempts to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow our entire system of government. But guess what? They failed, and our poll numbers are higher today than they\\'ve ever been before. And we\\'re standing up to the defense of our Constitution, our freedom and democracy itself. We\\'re doing something that\\'s never been done in the history of our country. This movement has never taken place. Nothing like it ever. And the fake news can attest to it, because if they thought I was saying the wrong thing, it\\'d be out there immediately. It\\'d be all over the place. It\\'d be all over the place. Trump exaggerates. That\\'s terrible what he says. There has never been a movement like this, and it began very early. It began in 2016 with that wonderful, beautiful night. You remember that, right? That beautiful night in November. And we\\'re going to have another beautiful night in November. This time, it\\'s going to be November 3rd. Get ready, November 3rd. We\\'re coming. We\\'re coming. So we\\'re having great polls. You\\'re seeing the polls, except for some of the fake ones. And if I was treated fairly… Meaning, if you were treated fairly by the fake news, we\\'d be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldn\\'t even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, it\\'s probably going to be competitive. But I actually think we\\'re going to win by a lot, just like we did last time. But I really believe we\\'d be up 20 points. I mean, all they do is negative, negative, phony stuff. Russia, Russia, Russia. The impeachment hoax. That\\'s a hoax. But you know, we had great support from the Republican party in the House. It was 197 to nothing. And in the Senate, it was 52 and-a-half to a half. You know what the half was? A halfwit. And while the extreme left has been wasting America\\'s time with the hoaxes, we\\'ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. By the way, they turned away 21,000 people outside, so feel very good. Feel very good. We haven\\'t had an empty seat. You know what? We haven\\'t had… True. We haven\\'t had an empty seat, and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobody\\'s ever seen. But we haven\\'t had an empty seat since your great… and this is a great first lady. Came down the escalator with me in Trump Tower a long time ago. We haven\\'t had an empty seat. From our rural communities to our inner cities, we\\'re expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. You saw that, the geniuses. You saw that. You saw that last month. They were doing predictions on one of the shows. What do you think? Well, I think 60,000. What do you think? I think 100,000. What do you think? I think 84,000. These are the ones that tell you all about how to invest. What do you think? And then they came out 225,000, the market goes up again. 225,000. 225,000. So many manufacturing jobs. So many that frankly, we\\'re never going to come back. Remember, you need a magic wand, right? They came back. And remember this, we\\'re paying interest. The past administration didn\\'t pay interest. They pumped money in like it was candy. And we didn\\'t pump money in, we took money out. And not that I was happy about that, because I disagree with it. Because frankly, if we kept the old practice which frankly, some people could dispute one way or the other, we would have been up in my opinion, another 10,000 points in the Dow. And we\\'ve set 144 records on the stock market in three years, 144 records. 144 records. Record stock market. And you know what that means? That your 401Ks are up 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. Guys come up to me. He said, \"Mr. President, I just want to thank you. My wife used to look at me like I was a total loser, sir. Every year we lost money for years and years. She said what the hell is wrong with you, Henry? And this year sir, I\\'m up 92%. She loves to me again. She thinks I\\'m a genius.\" 92% 401K. \"She thinks I\\'m a genius, sir. She loves me again.\" Shows what money can do, right? But that makes… And think of this. Seven million new jobs since we were elected, we were elected. And when I took over, ISIS was all over the place. And we immediately started. We have destroyed 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We have killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi is dead. And we just took out the world\\'s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. And the fake news doesn\\'t want to tell you that. They don\\'t want to tell you that. They don\\'t want to tell you. In fact, do you remember the dog? Great dog, Conan. When we took out, right? We love Conan. Conan\\'s a tough dog. But when we took out al-Baghdadi, Conan… Remember this? Conan got more publicity than President Trump. That\\'s okay. They were looking for al-Baghdadi for 16 years. We found him and we took him out. We killed another one last week. The head of Al-Qaeda. He was gone, dead. And America is respected again, respected like never before. We\\'re respected again. We\\'re no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country, including by the way, our allies, who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies. I will tell you that. They take big advantage, but not so much anymore. We\\'re winning. We\\'re winning like never before. Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They hate the fact that we\\'re winning. We\\'re winning big. We\\'re winning, winning, winning. And that is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. They\\'re joining our great Republican party in droves. You see it all the time. I just spoke to some of your leaders. He said, \"This is unbelievable what\\'s happening. This is unbelievable.\" You know, there have never been rallies like that. Sleepy Joe Biden the other day had 68 people. And now they have a new member of the crew, mini Mike. Mini Mike. No boxes, we call him no boxes. And I hear he\\'s getting pounded tonight. You know, he\\'s in a debate. I hear they\\'re pounding him. He spent $500 million so far, and I think he has 15 points. It just came out. Hey fake news, how many points does he have right now, 15? They won\\'t tell you the truth. They won\\'t tell you the truth. MSDNC, MSDNC is worse than CNN. They\\'re owned by a company called Comcast. You can have Comcast, a bunch of phonies. But MSDNC is worse than CNN, and they\\'re all pretty bad. You know, they just came out with a poll. They just came out with a poll a little while ago. Mini Mike was at 15, and crazy Bernie was at 31. That\\'s a lot. And mini Mike just spent $500 million. But the DNC is going to take it away from Bernie again. That\\'s okay, because we don\\'t care who the hell it is. We\\'re going to win. We\\'re going to win. We have to. Well let me tell you, these crooked politicians, they really took away three years from us. Because despite the fact and nobody disputes it, that we\\'ve done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything, we\\'ve done more than any administration in history. We\\'ve done more. But think of it, think of it. We did it with phony witch hunts. We did it with the impeachment hoax over our head the whole time. We did it under circumstances that should never ever happened to another President again. True. But with your energy and enthusiasm this November, we\\'re going to take back the House, we\\'re going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best, greatest. I love them. Leaders in America, Arizona leaders. I want to start. Come on up here, Governor Doug Ducey. Come on up here, Doug. Come on up here. You\\'re going to speak in a second. Also, I call them warriors because they fought like hell. They worked with our future Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. But we have some of your great warriors. Paul Gosar, come up here, Paul. Come up here. Andy Biggs. Andy Biggs, head of the Freedom Caucus. Andy Biggs. David Schweikert. David, come up here. A big, big star. You know about that, Doug. She became this monster star. She looked with such indignation at the other side, such disgust, Debbie Lesko. He\\'ll be running some day. You said your grandson? Wow. He\\'ll be running someday. Arizona Senate President, you know who that is, right? Karen Fann. Come up, Karen. Arizona House Speaker, Rusty Bowers. Vice President of the Navajo nation, Myron Lizer. And Arizona Republican party State Chair, Kelly Ward. Kelly Ward, come up. And we have a lot of other leaders, but we\\'ve got to get back to speaking. Do me a favor before I introduce a very special guest, I\\'d like to ask your great Governor… You know, he won like by 16 points. It wasn\\'t even a contest. You know, I\\'m very competitive. I want to beat him. Will you please get out to the polls so we can beat him? But he\\'s tough to beat. Doug Ducey, say a couple of words, please. Please. These are great people, great people. Thank you very much. So you know, before I introduce somebody very important to all of us, to me… Also, I have to say with us tonight is an Arizona hockey great, a friend of mine. He\\'s a great golfer too. He\\'s a tough golfer. I\\'ll tell you, he\\'s tough to beat. He\\'s tough as hell. And if you beat him in golf, he\\'ll try and beat you physically. He doesn\\'t care. He was the toughest hockey player. He was one of these guys, he could beat you one way and if he couldn\\'t, he just beat them up, right? He\\'d beat him up. And he\\'s a friend of mine. He\\'s a great guy, Jeremy Roenik. Where\\'s Jeremy? Where is he? Thank you, Jeremy. He\\'s a winner. We\\'re also joined by Donald, Jr. and Kimberly. They\\'re great people, great. And RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. And RNC finance chairman, also happens on a team called the Chicago Cubs, I shouldn\\'t tell you that… Todd Ricketts. So finally, it\\'s my great honor to introduce a tremendous person, a great fighter pilot. A lot of people don\\'t know that. She\\'s a great fighter pilot and a warrior Senate. She helped us so much during the impeachment hoax, she didn\\'t wobble one bit, Martha McSally. You know, Martha\\'s tough on the border. And she\\'s working with me to strengthen our military still further, and lower your prescription drug prices. We\\'re making a lot of progress. But her opponent, I have to say this Martha, a guy named Mark Kelly. Even the Democrats don\\'t like him much. He wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, give away free healthcare to illegal immigrants, and he wants to obliterate your second amendment. He wants to get rid of it. The radical liberal Democrats from California and Massachusetts, they\\'re pouring money into Kelly\\'s campaign, because they know that he\\'s a rubber stamp for crying Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, and nervous Nancy wacko Pelosi. And we\\'re going to have a new Speaker. But that\\'s why Martha has my complete and total support and endorsement, and we have to all get out there and make sure that Martha McSally… She\\'s a warrior. Let me tell you, you don\\'t know. We don\\'t know. People don\\'t know, people. This one is tough as hell, and that\\'s what we need. Martha McSally. Thank you. We\\'ll be back. Thank you Martha. Well, she\\'s right. How about that Congressman Al Green? We can\\'t beat him, so we have to impeach him. How about that? That\\'s not what our… as they call them, the founders. How many times did you hear the name, the founders? That\\'s not what the founders had in mind. But we\\'re going to have a big, big election victory. We\\'re working to- But we\\'re going to have a big, big election victory. We\\'re working together. I don\\'t think the Republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now. I really don\\'t believe so. So whatever you can do for Martha, we need her. It\\'s been so incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you for everything, Martha. I appreciate it. Thank you. Together we\\'re building the world\\'s most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere. We\\'re inclusive. This is the Republican party. We\\'re inclusive. Right here in… Right? You know that. Right here in America, right here in Arizona, we\\'ve created 240,000 new jobs right here. Including over 60,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here. Nobody thought it was possible. You\\'ve had the best year that you\\'ve ever had. Arizona, you\\'ve had the best year, the most successful year that you\\'ve ever had in the history of the country. It\\'s the best year you\\'ve ever had. So I\\'m going to take all the credit away from your governor. I don\\'t care. No, we have a great team with Doug and everybody else, but you\\'ve had the greatest year. You know that, Doug, number one year in the history of your state. It\\'s an incredible achievement. Incredible achievement. I don\\'t know, this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage. We\\'ll talk about, \"Well, you had the best… In many states, the best year they\\'ve ever had.\" Then they said, \"Let\\'s get a new president.\" I don\\'t think that\\'s going to work so easily. The country\\'s had the best year it\\'s ever had. Let\\'s get a new president. Let\\'s put in crazy Bernie. Let\\'s go. Crazy Bernie. Unemployment has reached its slowest rate in over 51 years, half a century. The average unemployment rate for my administration… Think of this. The average, so we\\'re talking about now more than three years, is the lowest for any US president in recorded history. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, lowest in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country. African American and Hispanic American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in 71 years. Soon to be historic. And veterans\\' unemployment has dropped to a record low. We\\'re working with our veterans, we\\'re taking care of our veterans like nobody\\'s ever taken care of our veterans. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached the lowest level in history. Workers without a high school diploma, you have a lot of them. They left high school. They said, \"I should have finished.\" They left. They can\\'t go back. They left. We\\'ve achieved the lowest unemployment rate without a diploma ever recorded in US history. Isn\\'t that great? They\\'re great numbers. Hispanic Americans right now, more than 500,000 own a home. More than 500,000 more own a home. And we\\'ve lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls. Think of that. 10 million people have come off of the welfare rolls. And happily. Not that we did anything. They have jobs and they love them. They\\'re making much more money and they love getting up and going for work. If they don\\'t like that job, they can get another one, because people are starving to get great employees right now. They\\'re starving to get great employees. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median income. Think of this. This is such a big deal. Median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country. Under President Bush, in eight years it went to $450 more. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, under a period of eight years, it went to $975. Under president Donald J. Trump… Did you ever hear of him? In only three years, including regulation cuts and tax cuts… Because the other ones raise taxes. We cut taxes by the record amount. It went to $10, 000 per family. A record. A record. That\\'s why our consumer right now, our people, they\\'re booming with cash. That\\'s one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better. China had the worst year in the last 67 years. Asia\\'s doing poorly. Europe is doing poorly. The United States is doing great. We\\'re doing the best we\\'ve ever done. The best we\\'ve ever done. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment, and these are really communities that need it the most, we created Opportunity Zones. We worked with Tim Scott, the great senator from South Carolina. His idea. He came in and saw me. I said, \"Let\\'s give it a shot.\" Nothing\\'s worked over the years, but this has really worked. Now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Arizona alone. From Apache to Navajo and Maricopa Counties. We\\'re supporting working families by fighting pay. We are doing a job with paid family leave. We\\'re doing something that nobody\\'s ever done to this extent. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pocket thanks to the Republican child tax credit. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and cutting through job, killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before. We\\'ve ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers. For the first time, America is now energy independent. Such beautiful words. Energy independent. We fought wars. We did everything we could. We used to take the straits and everybody else benefited. We\\'d them clear so that other countries could take oil from the Middle East with… That nobody paid us. Now they\\'re starting to pay us a lot of money, folks. They took advantage of us. But we have everything we need right now. We have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines. The Keystone Pipeline, Keystone XL. I approved it. The Dakota Access Pipeline. I approved it. 48,000 jobs. We\\'re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. The worst trade deals any human being has ever seen. I said, \"Who made these deals?\" The worst, stupidest deals I\\'ve ever seen. They were good for other nations. If you like other nations, that\\'s great. But we\\'re now putting America first. It\\'s very simple. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations, and really, the most corrupt special interests anybody\\'s ever seen. To ship our jobs and our factories to other countries. We lost our taxes, we lost our workers, we lost our companies, and we did nothing about it. Now we\\'ve done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA, the worst deal ever made, worst trade deal ever made, and one that was almost as bad and gave China an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the World Trade, WTO. One of the worst deals that we participated in this. By the way, we just won $7.5 billion in a lawsuit with WTO. We weren\\'t winning anything. We weren\\'t winning anything, but they said, \"I think this guy\\'s going to pull out.\" They treated us so unfairly. We were always in the minority position. I mean, who the hell negotiated these deals? But they look at us and they say, \"Look, if we\\'re not treated fairly, we\\'re gone.\" All of a sudden, we\\'re winning all these cases. But we just won 7.5 billion. 7.5 billion. Did you know that, Doug? 7.5 billion. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America\\'s no longer for sale. America is no longer for sale. Those days are over. Two generations of politicians came and went promising to replace NAFTA. How many times have you heard we\\'re going to replace NAFTA? Probably the number one reason I ran for office. Are we glad I ran for office? I think so. It\\'s funny, I was watching the different… I find it fascinating. I\\'m watching the different returns coming in and I\\'m watching as much as I can of this stuff. I love it. We all love it. If you don\\'t love it, you\\'re not going to do it very well. The crazy New York Times, which was a dead newspaper when I ran, it was dead as a doornail. A month before I ran, Doug, I held up a New York Times, it was like what you get thrown in your face at a supermarket. It was a thing. It just flew away. There was nothing. Now it\\'s doing very well. But you know what? Someday we won\\'t be here. When we\\'re not, those papers are in big trouble. But this thing was a dead newspaper. But I was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they\\'re doing. They have Mini Mike has spent $411 million. It\\'s a question mark, how\\'s he going to… I\\'ll tell you how he\\'s going to do. He\\'s probably not going to get the democratic nomination. That\\'s how he\\'s going to do. But Mini Mike, $411. Then they had this idiot, Steyer. We call him impeachment Steyer. How did that work out, Steyer? He\\'s another beauty. The guy worked… He spent 210 million. He got one-third of 1% in Iowa. In New Hampshire he did much better. He got less than 3%. Guy\\'s in there for like 250 million. How did it work out, Steyer? You jerk. I never even heard of him. I never even heard of him. I turn on every time… For years, I\\'m turning on… Impeach him. They don\\'t even know why. They never say why. They don\\'t have any reason. Impeach the president. This guy spent a fortune on this stuff, so it worked out pretty good. But anyway, so then I go and I look. It has Mini Mike\\'s… Question marks. I can give you the answer, but right now they have to have a question mark, right? Then they go down and they had other people. Some of them I like. They have Ross Perot, who honestly… It was a tough day for Bush when he joined the campaign. Because Clinton didn\\'t win. Ross Perot took away 19% of the votes. Didn\\'t Clinton get 41 or 43%? Give me a break. But that\\'s okay. Whatever. But they had Ross Perot spent like 100 million, which is probably double if you bring it up to today\\'s dollars. Then they have different people. A friend of mine who ran, Steve Forbes, he ran twice. He was in for a lot. Then they had Donald Trump. Now, this is your own money. This is your own money. I said I\\'d spend a lot of money on my primaries. We\\'ll see how the hell we do. It\\'s amazing. Once you win, money comes in. It comes in pretty fast. What\\'s that all about? But so in the middle they had Trump, and then they had four or five that were behind me. Lot of money spent. Loss, loss, loss, loss, loss. But in the middle they have Donald Trump. It didn\\'t say 500 million, and it didn\\'t say 250 like this Steyer guy. It didn\\'t say… It said 70 million of my own money. I spent 70. It said, \"Donald Trump won the presidency of the United States.\" Right? We won. My father would teach me, if you could spend less and win, that\\'s better than spending a lot and winning. Crooked Hillary spent at least three times more than we did and lost. Crooked as hell. She\\'s crooked as hell. We have a double-sided justice. It\\'s very unfair what\\'s going on. Very unfair. But let\\'s see how it all works out, folks. Let\\'s see how it all works out. I hope you\\'re going to be happy. I hope you\\'re going to be happy, because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there. Dishonest scum. Dirty cops, a lot of dirty cops. By the way, the FBI, those guys in that are incredible. But the ones on top, they were absolute scum. What they were trying to do, if that happened to Obama, or a Democrat, or especially a liberal Democrat, they\\'d be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already. They spied on our campaign. Remember that. After they spied, we won. Then after we won, they tried to get us out of office. It\\'s never happened before in the history of our country, and we can\\'t let that happen. We can never ever excuse it. We can never let them get away with that. Never let them get away with it. But we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great. The last month, we ended the NAFTA… Look, you saw it. NAFTA catastrophe. That\\'s what it was. We ended that catastrophe. Again, I really ran because of NAFTA. I said, \"How stupid.\" All over the place. In your state, but you go to New England, empty factories, empty buildings. Still you have empty buildings. We lost so much. We lost 60,000 factories and plants. I signed that brand new, beautiful US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, and ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Arizona. By the way, for people with the small farms and small businesses, if you love your children, you can now leave your companies, you can leave your farm, you can leave your ranch to your children, and you don\\'t have to to pay, they don\\'t pay a death tax. They don\\'t pay an inheritance tax. A big deal. That\\'s a big deal. So if you love your children, it\\'s good. If you don\\'t love your children, it doesn\\'t matter. Don\\'t leave it to them, if you don\\'t love. If your children are no good to you, don\\'t give them anything. Let them go out and work like hell. No, if you love… Does anybody in this incredible audience… Man, this is a big building. Does anybody not love their children? Anybody? Do I have a hand? Do I have a… There\\'s a hand. You\\'ve got to be kidding. You\\'ve got to be kidding. So then you don\\'t care about the tax. Okay, don\\'t worry about it. He says, \"No, I don\\'t care about that one.\" Well, that\\'s good. You look like a nice guy too. He\\'s tough. You\\'d love to be his kid, wouldn\\'t you? But I also took the strongest ever action to confront China\\'s massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports. China will invest $250 billion a year into the United States and buy our products and create jobs. Nothing like that has ever happened before. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. That\\'s the way we want it. We are finally putting our country first. We are putting America first. On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than immigration. You know it almost better than anybody. Anybody, Doug. You know it better than anybody, what they\\'ve done on your border, but we\\'re stopping that border. That border is clogged, and we\\'ve started the big wall right in Arizona. We build a lot of wall. That\\'s a big one. That\\'s a big one. Top of the line. Before I came into office, the far left\\'s policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children. Including, as you know very well right here in Arizona, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border. Then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, healthcare, everything. They want to give them everything. For a long period of time, they were treated… You know this before I came. They were treated far better than our veterans were treated. Now our veterans are treated great. True. Illegal immigration costs Arizona taxpayers more than $2 billion every year. Two billion you\\'re paying. Nearly 20% of Arizona\\'s annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem. For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild our cities all throughout America, which is what we should be doing. Under my administration, we are finally taking care of our own citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities. Every day, Democrats\\' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives. In Arizona alone last year, ICE officers arrested over 4,500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Right here in Phoenix, an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street. This savage animal had previously been deported after serving six years in prison. He was in prison six years. He was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it. They want to protect them. Last year in Tucson, another illegal alien was sentenced to 10 years for repeatedly raping a vulnerable young woman. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals, and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into America\\'s communities. Thankfully, Arizona has banned sanctuary cities. With a Republican majority in Congress, we will ban them in every state in America. 30 in the morning. I then went to California, made two speeches. I then went someplace else. I said, \"Am I finished?\" No, you\\'ve got to go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25,000 people. I said, \"That\\'s okay. That\\'s okay.\" I said, \"That\\'s okay.\" No, I said, \"That\\'s okay,\" because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd. But you know what? Honestly, there\\'s tremendous energy in our nation. There\\'s tremendous energy in our nation. Greatest nation in the world. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row, which will soon be a record. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring. The month of January saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years. And we\\'ve ended catch and release, a horrible Democrat policy that we got terminated. Border patrol, great people, have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year. We\\'ve deported record numbers of gang members, including the worst gang of all, MS-13. Thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country. We\\'ve done more to secure the border than any administration in history. We\\'re building the wall, as I said, faster than ever. It will soon be almost one new mile a day. We\\'re looking for that. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme, taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders. How\\'s he doing tonight? 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie\\'s healthcare takeover of the world. Think of this, 180 million Americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan. But if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m not going to criticize it tonight. Let them keep going and I\\'ll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election. Okay? Because I don\\'t want him to change. Please don\\'t change. Same with the Green New Deal. I don\\'t want to talk about it, Doug, tonight. I don\\'t want to talk about it. I came up with the name Pocahontas. Too early. But fortunately, she\\'s self-destructed anyway. Did you ever see a phony like that? She\\'s a phony. She lost because she couldn\\'t keep it straight on her own heritage. She said she was an Indian. I said, \" I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none.\" She said, \"Oh,\" and she panicked. She panicked, and she had a test. You know the result, 1/124th. I think I win the bet. Somewhere along the line, I think I win. No, she… I did it too early. I would have saved it, but I guess it was effective. She\\'s essentially gone-zo, so… One of those things. While the socialist Democrats are try- … one of those things. While the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your social security, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. And that\\'s what we\\'re getting. That\\'s right. One of the big secrets. The Democrats won\\'t let us say it. They want to keep that as quiet as possible. Look what they gave you, the worst healthcare. And what we\\'ve done, we\\'ve gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you. Everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice. We\\'re making healthcare better and much, much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office, we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were, and it\\'s better healthcare. A lot of people don\\'t know this. People don\\'t know this. They think that\\'s their issue. It\\'s not. They failed on healthcare. We\\'re protecting people with preexisting conditions, and we always will. And by the way, we\\'re trying to get rid of Obamacare, but we\\'re managing it incredibly, but we\\'re trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions. Remember that. We\\'re trying to get rid of it, but while we\\'re having it, we\\'re managing it really much better than they did. Remember they built the $5 billion website? Remember that? It was supposed to cost $5 million. It cost $5 billion. $5 billion. I mean, you could get a kid out of high school. I have a son. He\\'s a young boy, 13. He uses a computer. He could have given them a healthcare site. I would say he would have charged them $100, Barron Trump, and it would\\'ve worked. He\\'s so good. \"Hi dad. How you doing, dad? How\\'s it going?\" Bing, bing, bong. I said, \"Don\\'t play with that while you\\'re talking to me.\" \"What\\'s going on, dad?\" These kids are incredible, right? The kids, they make us look like babies with that. But he could have given you a great site for about $2. They spent $5 billion on a site that never worked. By the way, speaking of that, how did they do with their vote count in Iowa? And I hear, I hear, I don\\'t want to say it. I don\\'t want to jinx them because, of course, I want them to do well, but I do. We don\\'t have anything. Nobody\\'s running against us in so many states. It\\'s sort of nice. We can save the thunder, right? But I hear that in Nevada. I\\'m hearing bad things about their vote count. I hear a lot of bad things are happening, like they don\\'t know what the hell they\\'re doing. I turned on the other night, Iowa, I wanted to see … And by the way, we set a record in the history of Iowa. We had more votes than anybody\\'s ever had as an incumbent president. Same thing in New Hampshire. It\\'s a good sign. It\\'s a good sign. By a lot. By the way, by a lot. But I\\'m hearing that, and I hope this isn\\'t the case because I\\'d like to find out who the hell won. We still don\\'t know who won in Iowa. I heard coming over here they\\'re still working on the count. No, no, no. He said, \"You won.\" Yeah, I think we did win. I think we did. Very good. That\\'s very good. I have to thank you, that one. That\\'s very good. No, we did win. Look, we are winning. We\\'re winning big. We have fake polls out there. These guys do fake polls. They are fake polls. I had a poll. It\\'s just like it was in 2016. I\\'d hear these polls. I\\'d hear women didn\\'t like me, and I did great with women. I hear everyone didn\\'t like me. Nobody liked me. Nobody liked me. And then we won. Thank you, women. Nobody liked me 2016. No, no, I hear that. Remember, women didn\\'t like him, and at the end of that he did great with women. He did great with this. He did great with everybody. We did great with everybody. Remember, 306 to 223. That\\'s a slaughter. That\\'s a slaughter. Remember, they said he cannot get, they used the word path. There is no path, right, to 270? I was at 269 if I did great, but they said there\\'s no chance. But I was at 269, so I went to Maine. I love Maine. I went to Maine. Maine\\'s cut in half. And one Maine has one. I went there four or five times. People are great. I won it. And they were right. There is no path to 270, but there was a path to 306. These people. These people. There is no path. That\\'s right, Doug. They said there is no path, the fake news media. \"There is no path for Donald Trump.\" And then they said the evening of the election, \"It\\'s going to be a really short night for Donald Trump. Thank God, we got rid of this guy.\" Because they did the exit polls going out, right? And I was even told, but a lot of people didn\\'t want to talk about it. The highest number in history of people that said very nasty language, but I\\'m not going to use that name because you\\'ll kill me if I use it. So I won\\'t use it. It\\'s a much better story if I use it because that\\'s the truth. That\\'s what they said. \"How did you vote?\" Usually, they say, \"I voted for Clinton,\" or, \"I voted for Trump.\" Right? \"How\\'d you vote?\" \"None of your business.\" See, I\\'m being nice, right? I\\'ll keep it that way because otherwise we\\'ll ruin the whole evening. They\\'ll say, \"His language,\" right? Even this tough guy in the front says, \"I agree.\" \"How did you vote?\" \"No, I don\\'t want to tell you.\" \"How did you vote?\" \"None of your damn business. I\\'m not going to tell you.\" \"How did you vote?\" \"I\\'m not … \" And it was like this massive number, right? Massive. So everybody, they just didn\\'t count that. So they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked Hillary Clinton. They\\'re looking unbelievable. This is going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump. We finally will be rid of this guy. And then the numbers started coming in. The numbers started coming in, and it started with the great state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. And then that beautiful convention center, the most beautiful stage I\\'ve ever seen. And they knew something was going on because they didn\\'t pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before. Right? In fact, I went to the fireworks company, and I said, \"I\\'ll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks,\" even though they were no way near where my area was. We were at a hotel in Midtown. We liked the location better than where she chose, but they built the most … we remember that beautiful stage. It was shaped like the United States of America. And by the end, it didn\\'t look too good. Did you ever see more unhappy people? So they go, \"Donald Trump has won the great state of Florida. They go, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa.\" They outspent me like five to one. Only negative ads. They\\'re all negative. So by the time people got into the voters booth, they only knew one thing. She hated Donald Trump, but they said, \"What the hell does she stand for? What does she do?\" Every ad was a negative ad. So it tells you negative ads, at least against me, aren\\'t so good. They can be effective. But I think they spent like $ 2 billion on negative ads. Everything was negative. So nobody knew what the hell she spent. You know, her husband said she was going to lose. Her husband\\'s a professional. Her husband said, \"You better go to Michigan because I was there and they got a Trump/Pence sign on every lawn I\\'ve ever seen. You better go to Wisconsin, Hillary. You better go to Wisconsin.\" She said, \"No, we haven\\'t lost Wisconsin in 36 years\". \"No, no, Hillary, you got to go there. I\\'m telling you, I don\\'t like what I saw.\" \"No, what do you know?\" He\\'s a professional politician. She wasn\\'t. It\\'s one of those little problems in life. So then it came in, and then we won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. Right? And we were leading Pennsylvania by so much that if I lost, remember at 2% of the vote left, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot. They refused, the fake news refused to call it. I kept saying, \"We won Pennsylvania. Why don\\'t they call it?\" It was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake, they\\'re crooked. They are fake. And I said, \"Why don\\'t they call Pennsylvania?\" But some beautiful things happened. And by the way, Ohio, we won by one of the largest margins ever. The great, great, great state of Ohio. Remember? Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, \"Well, nobody can win. Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio.\" And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big. We knew we were going to win it. And now we\\'re up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why? We\\'re bringing back jobs. We\\'re bringing back factories. Everybody\\'s working. Nobody\\'s ever had a better year than we\\'ve been having. And we\\'ve been doing it for a long time, right? Almost from the beginning. And don\\'t let them try and take credit, because if they came in, we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse, the D word, depression. We would have been, because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on. And I\\'ll tell you, maybe bigger than even the tax cuts, and I did it sooner, were the regulation cuts. We freed up our nation to go back to work. True. So then we won Wisconsin, and then we won Michigan because those companies, now they\\'re pouring back in. The auto companies are pouring back in, and Wisconsin\\'s doing great with the farmers that Canada was taking. You know, Canada was charging our farmers 287% tariffs for dairy products. Okay? So what happens is this, we\\'re working on healthcare. We\\'re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. We\\'ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction. We\\'ve totally transformed veteran\\'s healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done. And we passed the spectacular right to try. So if you\\'re in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arena\\'s in trouble, but if you\\'re in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs. You get it. And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives. It\\'s incredible what\\'s happening. People would go to Europe. They\\'d go to Asia. If they had no money, they\\'d go home and die. Now they have the right to use our drugs before they\\'re approved. Think of that. Before they\\'re approved. And we\\'re very importantly combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths. The overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 34 years, and life expectancy is rising again in our nation. We\\'ve launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer\\'s disease. We\\'re making tremendous progress, and we\\'re pursuing new advances in neo-medical research. Think of that, neonatal research, the numbers are incredible. What\\'s happened is incredible, to care for America\\'s youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so. All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why in my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We have tremendous energy. Tremendous energy. Everybody says to me, \"Where do you get the energy?\" Because I love what we\\'re doing. I see the results, and they\\'re happening faster than you even think. You see the numbers. They\\'re happening faster than you would even think. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We are the party with big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right? Right? To keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life. There\\'s been nothing like this. I passed criminal justice reform, not the Democrats. I did it with the Republicans, and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the Republican party. The Democrats did not do it. They could never have done it.  Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including nearly $200 million for Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. Right? I recognized Israel as the true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognize Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They\\'ve been trying to get it for 52 years. And for years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You saw that. They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Arizona. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. It is. This election is so important. It\\'s the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. You\\'re the forgotten people no more. Right? No deplorables, right? No deplorables. Who knew that was going to turn out to be such a disaster? But you know, she used the worst word. What was the word she used? Irredeemables, right? I thought that was the problem. No, it was deplorable. So what the hell do I know about politics? She said, \"You\\'re irredeemable and deplorable.\" I said, \"Oh, that irredeemable\\'s terrible.\" The next day people are showing up. Women, \"I\\'m a deplorable.\" Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp, which is vicious, horrible, ugly, and evil. Much worse than I thought. But we\\'re getting there and not pleasant. A bunch of really bad people, very dishonest people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words and phrase. I love the phrase, Made in the USA. Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within now nine years. We started a year ago. Can you imagine that? We\\'re doing that, and it\\'s going to happen. Who would have thought we could have done that? We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, and you know this. You know it\\'s under siege, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will defend it. It\\'s under siege. It\\'s under siege. You see it in Virginia. They want to take away the guns. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto In God We Trust. From Tucson to Tombstone, right? Do you agree? You agree, right? Look at him. He\\'s agreeing, this guy. He\\'s agreeing. No more censorship is right. No more evil. No more crimes. You\\'re right. From Yuma to Mesa and from Flagstaff to right here in Phoenix, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom. Arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors, great prospectors, cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, braved the blazing sun, and it is hot here. I\\'ve been here during the summer. I want to tell you, it\\'s seriously hot. Of course, didn\\'t they say that President Clinton, when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf, it was 121 degrees that day? I don\\'t know about that. I don\\'t know about that. What do you think he was doing with the Attorney General? I remember he said, \"Oh, I just happened to see she was … I was here to play golf. It was 120 degrees out.\" I don\\'t know. A lot of crooked stuff went on. I wonder what they talked about. I\\'m sure it wasn\\'t that she would become a Supreme Court Justice. I\\'m sure it wasn\\'t that they were going to extend her tenure as Attorney General. She was a real beauty. I\\'m sure it wasn\\'t. I\\'m sure it was nothing. They spent 45 minutes on the plane talking about golf and their grandchildren. Right? Can\\'t let it happen, folks. Can\\'t let it happen. We can\\'t let it happen. You fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are making it greater every single day than ever before. Great, great, great citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and with your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Do you like winning? Because not very long ago you weren\\'t winning, and I don\\'t want you … I told this a few times during the campaign. Haven\\'t used it in a long time, but I don\\'t want you going to your great governor. He\\'s a great governor, Doug Ducey. I don\\'t want you going to your governor saying, \"Governor, governor, we just can\\'t stand winning so much. Please go see the president in the oval office. Governor, the people of Arizona don\\'t want to keep on winning. It\\'s too much governor. It\\'s not even fair to the rest of the planet. Please tell him, Governor Ducey, please tell him, ‘President, the people of Arizona have won too much. We don\\'t want to keep on winning.\\'\" And I\\'ll look at Doug Ducey, and I\\'ll say, \"Doug, I\\'ve a lot of respect for you, Doug. You won by 16 points. That means a lot. But Doug, I don\\'t care what you say. We\\'re going to keep on winning, and we\\'re going to win like never before. And the people of Arizona are going to love it.\" And he\\'s going to say, \"Thank you, Mr. President. I\\'m going back home.\" The fact is, we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Arizona, the best is yet to come. That\\'s right. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Arizona. Thank you. \\nSo thank you Pennsylvania, very much. I\\'m thrilled to be in Latrobe, the home of the late, great, my friend, Arnold Palmer. What a great guy he was. What a great guy. Thank you very much. 61 days from now, we\\'re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in the White House. Joe Biden wants to surrender your jobs to China. You know that. His son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing. He wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob. He\\'s trying to change now. We say that\\'s not working because we\\'re going up and he\\'s dropping like a rock in water. And before the China virus, this election was over. Now I had to go back to work and we\\'ve done a great job on it. We don\\'t get the credit. We don\\'t get the credit. We made a lot of governors look very good. But I will keep your jobs in America, and I\\'ll bring rioters, looters, violent extremists, anarchists, we will bring them to justice. That\\'s what we\\'re doing right now. We have over 400 right now under arrest. These are bad people. Over the last three and a half years, we\\'ve secured America\\'s borders, fixed our broken trade deals, rebuilt the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, secured American energy independence, and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we\\'re going to do it again. Have to do it again. Have to do it again. Got to do it again. And it\\'s happening. You see what\\'s happening. Job numbers, retail sale numbers, they\\'re all at records. It\\'s happening. It\\'s happening very fast. It\\'s actually happening in a super V, not a V. It\\'s a super V and you\\'ll see that, and big numbers are coming out and have come out, and just watch your set or watch your newspaper. Read your newspaper. You\\'re seeing numbers that, congressmen, we haven\\'t seen those numbers ever before, actually. We\\'ve never seen them. And by the way, we have record stock markets. We have record everything. You\\'re going to have an incredible economic year next year. Your stocks are going up. Your 401s are through the roof. I had a little pause today. People wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way. But the stock market\\'s at record levels. Think of it. In the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic, we\\'re rounding that turn, and vaccines are coming along great. The job that they\\'ve done, the doctors, everybody else, we\\'re years ahead of schedule. Anybody else\\'s President, you wouldn\\'t be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now. I\\'ll tell you right now. That I can tell you. Biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family. He is a puppet of the socialists, Marxists, and the cop hating extremists. And they are cop hating. And we love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. And by the way, I don\\'t know if you saw this, if there\\'s any way of you seeing it, we have thousands of people behind this hangar, thousands, and we\\'re trying to get them in. And I\\'d love to get them in. I mean, it\\'s an airport. Let them go to the runways. Okay? Let them in. I mean, literally there, we landed. I actually thought that was the crowd. We\\'re doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can\\'t do it because of the pandemic for a while, a little while. But in certain ways, I like this better. I don\\'t have to travel. I get off the plane. I make a speech. I get the hell out of here. No, these are great. Do you remember the last days before the campaign? I\\'d do a lot of them a day. Get off that plane. It was a little different plane. It was black and white instead of the blue and white. But we had some time. And that was an important day and that was an important year, 2016. But I will tell you, the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country. And we had a level of enthusiasm, I mean, even look today. With all going on, look at the kind of crowds we have. But we had record enthusiasm in 2016. By the way, was that greatest evening ever? November. And now it\\'s going to be November 3rd, and we\\'ll keep it going and we\\'ll get it all like a tree. You move that tree. It takes a little while to plant, your tax cuts. They\\'re going to raise your taxes. They\\'re going to take away your guns. Really, if you look. And you know, they\\'ll criticize me for saying this, the fake news media, which is back there, with their fake polls. The same as last year. We could just put it all on tape. The fake polls, the fake everything. You know, they\\'re called suppression polls. They\\'re meant to make you depressed. Are you depressed? You don\\'t look depressed. We have the real numbers. We\\'re leading everywhere. We are leading everywhere. I\\'ll tell you. I think we\\'re way ahead of what we were four years ago, and there\\'s far more enthusiasm. Our base is bigger. It\\'s stronger. And we\\'ve done the greatest job. Again, if we didn\\'t get hit by the plague from China, between us, I would have canceled, Mr. Congressman, most of the rallies. I wouldn\\'t have needed a rally. That\\'s a little bit unfair, but that\\'s okay. That\\'s what China\\'s done to our nation. They\\'ve screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways. Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China, and I\\'ve taken in billions and billions of dollars. We never took in 25 cents from China. And I gave $28 billion, right, $28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China. And our farmers are very unhappy. I don\\'t think we have too many farmers in this wonderful Pennsylvania town. I know we have a lot of boilermakers over there. We got a lot of boilermakers, I\\'ll be talking about them. Look at those guys. Nobody going to mess with them. I\\'ll tell you. We\\'re going to be talking about them in a minute. But for the entire summer, Biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in Democrat run cities all, burned down businesses, terrorized civilians, and just recently marched through the streets chanting, \"Death to America.\" This is what we have. Death to America. And by the way, we could end it like immediately. You saw what we did in Wisconsin. It ended. It took a while for the governor. You know, they have to ask us in. It\\'s like, otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it\\'s totally unnecessary. The National Guard is fantastic. I went to see them two days ago. Biden went there today. There was nobody there. There was nobody there. He was a little late. I was going to say, \"Hey, listen, we ended that problem.\" But we could end it in Portland. Wise guys in Portland. Anarchists. They\\'re agitators. They\\'re looters. I\\'ll tell you we could end it in Portland in a half an hour. We did it in Seattle. We told them we\\'re coming in. You either end it or were coming in. Congressman, we were going in the next day. We were all set. I was actually disappointed, to be honest. They ended it in Seattle. They took over 20% of the city. Do you believe this? And the mayor said, \"No, it\\'s going to be a summer of love.\" These people are crazy. So we end them very quickly. We end them very quickly. And now what we\\'re doing is we\\'re holding back funds for cities that don\\'t know what they\\'re doing, where they allow crime to run rampant. And we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue. I took out an old ordinance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you don\\'t get things like that today. They think that you should just have no cash bail. They do the no cash bail. You kill somebody. There\\'s no bail. Don\\'t worry about it. Go out. But I took out an old ordinance. I gave a new executive order. It says 10 years in prison. And amazingly, amazingly, that was three and a half months ago. And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere, and amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down. No statutes. And we\\'re actually prosecuting people for having done it. We made it retroactive to the beginning. Terrible. Terrible. And by the way, the state statues and monuments, they have to do the same thing. It\\'s real easy. But the rioters that want Biden to win, they want him to win because their agenda, it\\'s what they want. It\\'s the craziest thing I\\'ve ever seen. They both want to cut funding for police. They want to end that cash bail. They want to hire far left prosecutors and judges, and let the criminals run wild. The radical left District Attorney in Portland, Mike Schmidt, his name is, has released hundreds of rioters that announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, rioting, and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance. Oh, it\\'s worse. It\\'s worse. You have somebody in Philadelphia who\\'s worse, right? Worse. In his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, that\\'s what it is, Biden agreed to all these things. You notice now, \"No, no. I never said about fracking. I never said.\" If you don\\'t do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple. Other than that, I don\\'t think you should have it. Okay? No, but he said in the manifesto, plus he said many times, we put on the clip yesterday where he, no fracking, no this, no that, I mean, no guns. How about guns? No guns. No second amendment. Biden has pledged to a point prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide. That\\'s what he\\'s done. That\\'s called the manifesto. He agreed to all this stuff. The craziest thing, you\\'re supposed to bring it to the right. He actually brought it further left. Bernie never dreamt that this was possible, crazy Bernie. Do you know crazy Bernie? I had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago, a big percentage. You know why? Because I agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing, trade. The trade. Because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did I. Nobody else got it. Especially Biden never got it. He never got it. Still doesn\\'t get it. Now he really gets nothing. I tell you. He didn\\'t get it in prime time. Now he really doesn\\'t get it. But it\\'s okay for them to make every city look just like Portland which is a disaster. And again, we could clean it up. We just go right through it. 5,000, 10,000, right through it. These guys are tough. They\\'re smart. And they love our country. They love our country. We\\'ll clean it up in one half hour. It\\'ll be over.  strength. They don\\'t understand. Nice. They chased him out of his home. Unbelievable. Biden\\'s plan is to appease the domestic terrorist. And my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them. And I will always defend law abiding citizens. That\\'s why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people, you know, we have it from everybody. We just got the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, all of them. We got Ohio. We got Texas. We got North Carolina. We got South Carolina. We got everybody. I see Rick Perry right there. Rick Perry, what are you doing here, Rick? Rick Perry, one of the greats. But they\\'re all voting for me. This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. Today, I\\'m delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like. Sort of grew up with these people. I don\\'t know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us. What I\\'m endorsing, I\\'m getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people. They work hard. They do great. We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble. At last year, you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation, right? Of your whole operation. You\\'ve never had anything like that. This has been your greatest. This has been prior to the plague coming in. It\\'s been the Commonwealth\\'s greatest. Can we ever call the Commonwealth a state? You have two places. But you always have to say, well, wait a minute. Is this one a Commonwealth? Two places. You know what the other place is? Name it. Huh? That\\'s right. How did you know that, Congressmen? Huh? But this Commonwealth, it\\'s a great Commonwealth. It\\'s a great place. And the boilermakers, local union, it\\'s Local 154 of the boilermakers. They chartered in Pittsburgh 125 years ago. None of you were around to see it, and it now represents members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. And I want to thank John Hughes and the boilermakers here today. It\\'s a great honor to have you. Where\\'s John? Where the hell is John? Stand up, John. John, we appreciate it. We appreciate it. Do you know why John is the head? You know why? Because look, he\\'s got the worst location. I say, \"Where\\'s John?\" I\\'m looking in the front row. Put up your hand, John. Look at that guy. He\\'s great. You\\'ve got my vote, John. Hey, boilermakers, thank you. What a job you do. You\\'re the heart of this country. You really are. Thank you very much. That\\'s a great endorsement. That\\'s a great endorsement. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations. And I\\'ve spent the last four years bringing them back home and we\\'re bringing them back home. Bringing a lot of things back home. I ended the last administration\\'s eight year pure war on Pennsylvania oil, and coal, and fracking. If you look at the natural gas, what they\\'ve done to this state, what they were doing to this state. It was sort of easy. I just opened it up and I said, \"Do it.\" And the investment put into Pennsylvania, the investment put into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been record setting. But again, you had the greatest year you\\'ve ever had last year prior to the virus. You\\'re going to be set. Now with what we\\'re doing, I believe that this next quarter, which will be announced, interestingly, just prior to the election, so I\\'m putting myself on the line, but I know what\\'s going to happen. The numbers are going to be great. And next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for Pennsylvania, but for the entire country. So Joe Hiden, we have a new one, Joe Hiden. We call him Joe Hiden. I have all. What do you like better? What do you like better? We got a number. Let\\'s do a little poll. Can we do a poll? I saved myself so much money. You know, I saved myself so much money. We do these polls with thousands, and those people are coming in from the back, are they not? Yes? They\\'re coming in. I\\'m telling you wouldn\\'t have believed it. I\\'m landing. I wasn\\'t waving at you. I was waving at them. There\\'s more. But I do these polls. Right? And it\\'s like a perfect poll. Do you ever see the companies? You give them a million bucks and they do a poll, like 78 people were polled. Now you\\'ve got thousands of people. So tell me. What\\'s your feeling, first of all in the name You like MAGA, Make America Great Again? Yes? Oh, you are the one. You are a man. I made you famous today. You said the nicest things about me. Thank you. Did you see him on television today? I think you\\'re great. I think you\\'re great. Thank you. No, he called me a great Christian and a great Christian leader. Thank you. But he did say I wasn\\'t perfect, but that\\'s okay. I said thank you, anyway. Right? No, that was really great. That was really great. Biden- No that was really great. That was really great. But if you look at it, the things they\\'ve done, we\\'re going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because I love the people saying do this or do that. But one of the things I got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it\\'s so bad. It\\'s a rip off of our country. The so-called Paris Climate Accord. It\\'s a disaster, a death sentence. It\\'s a death sentence for your energy jobs. I took it out. I withdrew from that calamity. Biden pledged to reinstate it. It\\'s going to cost you billions and billions of dollars. You know what it really is? It\\'s a way of really taking advantage of the United States. This is what it is. Last year I visited the Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County. Anybody ever hear of Beaver County? The largest investment in your state\\'s history, all made possible by our pro-energy policies. Biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600,000 Pennsylvania workers. It\\'s probably 940,000 they say. Think of that. Also, prices and everything else. Now Biden today came out and said, \"No, no, fracking\\'s okay, it\\'s okay? Did you see that? Fracking\\'s okay. Because he was getting killed. And now we came out in favor of law enforcement. Look at all these handsome cops here. And a beautiful cop. If you would see how beautiful, if you would see how beautiful this is, it was like this perfect evening, the sun was setting, the faces of these great, great majestic heroes of our country, right? Heroes of our country. And they want to blow Mount Rushmore. But how about this one? The Democrats yesterday came out with a plan. Did you see it? Now, they\\'re the DC Democrats. They want to change the name of the Washington Monument, perhaps take it down. Thomas Jefferson, pretty good Thomas Jefferson, right? You could forget about ever hearing that name again. Abraham Lincoln, you could forget about it. They want to take down all statues, all monuments in Washington. We have some of your greatest people right here. Let me not even talk to the congressmen. The heck with the Congressman, the boiler makers. How do you like? How do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, all of them? I don\\'t think the boiler makers. You\\'ll do a ring around Washington right? Along with Christopher Columbus. He\\'s in big trouble I\\'ll tell you. Except there was one, there was a group of great Italians in New York, they tried to take down. They tried to take down Christopher Columbus statue in New York. You saw what happened, right? These Italians formed a little circle. They said, \"Come on.\" The agitators decided to leave. \"Let\\'s get out of here darling.\" They protected Christopher Columbus. The Italians, now the Italians aren\\'t big on taking down Christopher Columbus. You take down those statues you can forget about the Italian vote. Do we agree? But they protected it. When asked at the debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal, and fracking, and natural gas, and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work, and they produce just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country, Biden said, \"No, we would absolutely not allow anything like that. We would make sure it\\'s totally eliminated.\" That\\'s what he said. He said, \"We would make sure it\\'s totally eliminated or eliminated.\" Now he\\'s coming and saying, \"This isn\\'t working too well. This isn\\'t working.\" And I made a speech a week ago in Texas. We had crowds that were unbelievable, on the highways, you can\\'t get in, but the highways, it\\'s like incredible. You could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money, go to eBay. Even as a used ticket, you could probably sell. But you go down the highways and you see it, and I was thinking of Texas, I\\'m making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil, they like God, and you know what else they like, they like their Second Amendment, right? So think about it. So whether it\\'s Pennsylvania, or Texas, or Oklahoma, or North Dakota, or any place, you take a look at this, right? And no oil, no guns, no God. I don\\'t think George Washington running with Abraham Lincoln as his VP, he\\'ll pick Abraham Lincoln as VP is going to win in Texas, or in Pennsylvania, or any place else with those three things eliminated. That\\'s what they want to do. They want to take away your Second Amendment. If I weren\\'t president, you would either have an obliterated Second Amendment or it would be gone entirely. I am standing between them and your Second Amendment. And that\\'s it. That\\'s it. They know. We put Baido in charge of guns. Baido is in charge, he wants to get rid of everything. Baido, that\\'s a beauty. Remember he said, \"I was born for this.\" Anybody that says they\\'re born for this. Remember Baido? He was on the cover of a magazine, I won\\'t mention the magazine, they\\'re back there. It\\'s a total phony magazine. But he was on the cover of the magazine. And he said, \"I was born to run for president.\" He was born for it. I was born. Anybody that gets that character. That was when he was doing well. Since then he\\'s cratered. Ever since he made that statement, he\\'s looked very bad. But take a look at what he says about guns, and he got put in charge of guns. So I guess Biden pretty soon he\\'s going to be coming out saying, \"No, no. I never said that.\" Check out all of the statements he\\'s made on everything and now he\\'s going the opposite way, but he\\'s agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he\\'ll do that. And then he figures later on, he\\'ll go. But everything he said is right, because he has no control over what\\'s happening. The radical left has captured the party. They even elected a person that nobody ever heard of, a senator, it\\'s been a while, against a young, good looking Kennedy by 10 points in Massachusetts. Did you know Kennedy lost in Massachusetts? You know why? Because he wasn\\'t a radical left. He was like a semi-normal person, just slightly left. No, but think of it. This is what\\'s happened. And this is really what\\'s happened. If you\\'re not a radical lefty, meaning guns, meaning fossil fuels, they want wind, wind. To make the windmill, which are made mostly in China, and in Germany, by the way, to make it, so much emission is let out, that is more than you can ever save. It\\'s just the craziest thing. Also, I am truly an environmentalist, but you have to understand. When we do things and they don\\'t, and we clean, and it\\'s very expensive to do that and they don\\'t, and we have this massive planet, and China, India, Russia, Germany, all these places, it\\'s fuming up and we\\'re doing our job and beautiful. No, they have to do it also. Otherwise, it just doesn\\'t work the way it\\'s supposed to. They want to ban straws. Has anybody ever tried those paper straws? They are not working too good. Right? They want to ban straws, I said, well, I\\'ve had a couple of meals at McDonald\\'s, et cetera over the years, right? Wendy\\'s, a friend of mine owns Wendy\\'s, I\\'ll give it a plug, right? Burger King. So they want to ban straws. I said, \"Oh really? What about the carton? What about the plate? What about the knives and the spoons that are plastic?\" Oh, they\\'re okay, but the straws we got ban. Has anybody ever tried, seriously, the new straw, it\\'s made out of paper, right? It disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie, this would have no chance. By the time you get finished, the straw is totally disintegrated. Does anybody walk around with a plastic straw? Because it\\'s that bad. You whip it out, boom, boom. You never had to do that. When asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda, you know what the answer is, right? It\\'s the Green New Deal, right? This Green New Deal. This was made up by people that don\\'t get it. Either that or people that just don\\'t like our country very much. But Biden replied yes, he\\'ll get rid of those jobs. And he famously told a voter, \"I want you to look in my eyes,\" when he\\'s not wearing the mask because I\\'ve never seen a man that liked their mask. Look, I\\'m all for it, we have a big weekend, distance on the weekend, and all of that stuff, and wear your mask when you\\'re close together in particular, and wash your hands, all those things. We have Labor Day Weekend coming up. But did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him? And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always, but a lot of times he has it hanging down. Because you know what? It gives him a feeling of security. If I were a psychiatrist, right? I\\'d say, \"This guy\\'s got some big issues.\" Hanging down. Hanging down. Congressman, give me your mask. I want to have it hanging from my ear. I don\\'t want to touch your damn mask. Mike I\\'ll never touch your mask. No, but the new one is, I went for a physical, the doctor said to me, \"Sir would you like to go over to Walter Reed? It\\'s incredible.\" By the way, the job they do on people that have been just really hurt, our heroes. The job they do is incredible. \"Sir would you like to go over and do a physical? You have some time.\" You know why I had time? Some deal, oh, it was China. I decided not to see China because I didn\\'t like the way they were doing business, okay? Does that make sense? So the doctor, White House doctor, highly respected, Sean, Sean Conley, \"Sir would you like to go over and do your physical, or do a piece of it, or finish it?\" or whatever it was, but do a physic. I said, \"I don\\'t know. I\\'m not in love with the idea.\" \"Well, if you do it, you don\\'t have to do…\" \"Okay. Let\\'s go. Come on.\" So we went, we went, and we\\'re driving. Now you have to understand, they\\'re like a hundred cars. You see what happens here. It\\'s like the plane times 50. So the cars are driving all over to about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital, I get out. I was there probably for an hour and a half, two hours. And then yesterday I read that I had strokes. CNN, fake news CNN right there. No, it\\'s true. Mini strokes they called them. I don\\'t know what a mini stroke is, but it\\'s not good. And there could be a day and I\\'ll admit, I said \"Hey, it happens all of us.\" Right? Except these young ones. It\\'s never going to happen to them. And I\\'d look at it at that, but you know what happens? But nothing happened. So I went in, I did that part of the physical. The end result was he\\'s very healthy. They were very unhappy when they heard that result. What you don\\'t remember is when this took place, it was a long time ago. They just started up because they want to try and get me to be in Biden\\'s physical level. They view me as being somebody that\\'s, I go around, hey, last week, this week, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, South Carolina, back to Washington. Let\\'s go here, let\\'s go there, let\\'s go everywhere. Meetings all the time. I think I\\'ve answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history. And mean questions. I watched Biden yesterday, so he hasn\\'t answered questions in what, two months or something. And yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like I\\'ve never seen. One young woman who I think is there, one young woman is smiling, \"Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi. I just like to ask you, I\\'m sorry to bother you with this question.\" It\\'s the most incredible. So the doctor wrote a letter saying, \"No, this rumor is wrong.\" And I don\\'t like, rumors like that. And by the way, if it were a fact, it\\'s fine, it should. I think it\\'s an important thing. But if it\\'s not true, my wife was like, she came to me, she said, \"I think I would have known that.\" I said, \"Yeah, I think they would have known it too, because they drove back with me.\" The press follows me, they have a special deal, and then they followed me and then we go in, we go out. But if you remember, last time, I go in, I spend a little time, a physical like we all have. Hopefully you have them. Good thing to have I guess, as long as they give you a good answer. If they give you a bad answer don\\'t bother, possibly too late. But I go in, I come out a couple of hours later I guess, whatever it is, it\\'s a short time later, I get into the car, the press sees me get into the car. On my way home, I get a call from my wife, the First Lady who\\'s very popular. Do we like our First Lady? Very popular, great person, great woman. She said, \"Darling, are you okay?\" I go, \"Why do you ask?\" She said, \"They\\'re reporting that you had a heart attack.\" Now you have to understand I\\'m driving in a car, which is about what? Six cars in front of the press, because they have a big car. They\\'re a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible, make it uncomfortable. But they\\'re right behind me. So they know I got in and CNN reported that I had a heart attack. That was the same visit, and that didn\\'t work. No it\\'s unbelievable. CNN reported I had a heart attack so my wife was concerned. I said, \"No, not that I know of. And if I did, I think I\\'d be back there. No. I\\'ll be home in 15 minutes, darling. Thank you for caring.\" It\\'s always nice. It\\'s always nice. She sounded relieved. That\\'s good. When your wife sounds relieved. But she said, \" I wonder how that happened. Why did they do that?\" Because they\\'re fake news. So I go in and that rumor lasted for a little while, like a day or two. It lasted for a little while, no matter what I did. I\\'m in the same motorcade, I go in, and I go out. They know I\\'m in the motorcade, I actually have to report it, but I\\'m in the motorcade, and they said I had a… One of them said it was a massive heart attack. Think of it. Again, it could happen someday, okay? And when it does, I hope things work out. But they knew I\\'m in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news. Now for the same visit, that was the stupidest thing. From now on, when I go for a physical or something or go to the hospital, announce it because this was a quick thing. The doctor, he got me in a lot of trouble. He\\'s a great doctor. I said, \"No more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time.\" So now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the New York Times who\\'s a third grade reporter writes a book and he said, \"The vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go,\" I guess, under anesthesia. Do they still call it…? In the old days they called it anesthesia. It\\'s essentially the same thing. I don\\'t want to get into a situation like where Biden used a record player. Remember that? You go home, you turn on your record player. But the anesthesia. And I said, \"How could that be?\" So remember, this is the same visit, same visit. They said heart attack a long time. All of a sudden out of this book. And he said, \"Suffered mini strokes.\" Now they get a letter from the White House doctor that said it\\'s totally false, totally false. But they still go with it, they go with it. And they know I\\'m in the group with them coming back. And I don\\'t know much about a mini stroke, but I assume Mr. Congressman, if you have a mini stroke, you\\'re not heading back to the White House, right? At least you\\'ll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital, right? So anyway, these are really dangerous people. They are so bad for our country. If we had honest press, it would be so great for the USA. It would be so great. They\\'re just a bunch of phony people. Not all of them. You have some very good ones, like about 10%. No, you have some very good ones, you have some great journalists, they know it\\'s phony stuff. They\\'re doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the White House and I just don\\'t think the public is going to fall for it. I don\\'t think the public is going to fall for it. In his best days, 25, 30 years ago, he was weak. He was weak. As a Senator, he was weak. He was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it\\'s not exactly primetime, I can tell you that. I just want to announce tonight because we\\'re joined with some very, very special warriors and Dan Meuser, Dan, thank you very much. Great job you\\'re doing. Dan, Congressman. He\\'s a Congressman who have really been warriors for me. You really have been. Thank you very much Dan. Fred Keller, Fred, thank you. Great job, Fred. The great John Joyce. Great, thank you, John. Guy Reschenthaler. Do you know him? Guy Reschenthaler. what are you doing over there? What happened? You don\\'t get along with these guys? Oh, okay. That\\'s good. Now I understand. That\\'s good. Glenn Thompson. Great job, great job Glenn, really great. And a real good friend of mine, right from the beginning, right, Mike? We were in Pennsylvania and a friend of ours, a Congressman, longterm, right? From Kentucky. No, from actually Tennessee came up to us, I was getting ready to make a speech, and Tennessee is very early voting. Remember what he said? This was four years ago. He said, \"I don\\'t know what\\'s happening in Pennsylvania. I don\\'t know what\\'s happening in the rest of the country. But if what\\'s going on in the rest of the country is like what\\'s going on in Tennessee?\" He said, \"They\\'re coming from the Hills, the roadsides, the rivers.\" He said they\\'re coming, people that never really cared to vote, they\\'re great Americans, but they never wanted to vote for the people that they were seeing. He said, \"They\\'re miles long. They\\'ve got Trump here, Trump hats, Trump pins,\" right? Tennessee. Duncan, Congressman Duncan, right? Remember that Mike? That was the first time. I mean, they said that they\\'d never seen anything like it. Tennessee has been incredible by the way. So Mike and I listened and we said, \"I wonder what that\\'s all about.\" But it is true. People that weren\\'t really political people, they\\'re coming in, and the deal here, like the Miss Universe, good old Miss Universe, right? Like this, they came with hats, they came with pins, they\\'re loaded with pins. One person had hundreds of pins. They never would\\'ve had a pin in their life, but they love the job that we\\'ve done and we\\'re going to do it even better in the next four years. Another great friend of mine who\\'s a tough cookie and a great Congressman. But unfortunately he\\'s a former because he\\'s just, I don\\'t know., He\\'s just a special guy and really has a big, beautiful heart, Lou Barletta, Lou. You look good Lou. Why don\\'t you run again Lou? And a man who is tough. There\\'s this guy. You ever hear of a guy named Conor Lamb? He\\'s like a lamb. So we heard, because he\\'s in sort of a Trumpy area, right? And we heard that he\\'s going to be for Trump, but he\\'s going to be fighting for Trump. I saw some of his commercials, I thought he was a Republican, right? Except when he got to Washington, he voted with Pelosi a hundred percent of the time. Craziness. He voted with craziness. And so we thought, this Conor lamb guy, he even voted to impeach your president over nothing. Zero. Zero. And that\\'s very personal. When they do that, that\\'s personal. And I have to say congressmen, 196 to nothing they stuck with us and so did the Senate other than Romney. You can have Romney I think. Remember he was walking with the Black Lives Matter saying, \"Yes, I\\'m a member of Black Lives Matter.\" Everyone said, \"That\\'s nice. Wonderful.\" He had a lot of mask on, I\\'ll tell you that. But we did a great job, it was an amazing thing. But this Conor Lamb was out there fighting it, and he shouldn\\'t have done that. And we have somebody that blows him away. He\\'s more of a hero, he\\'s tougher, he\\'s stronger, he\\'s smarter, he\\'s better looking, not that, that matters. Under the me too generation, I don\\'t talk about looks anymore. Looks don\\'t matter. Doesn\\'t make any difference. I don\\'t talk about looks. Me too. Me too generation. But I\\'ll tell you, this man is something special. He\\'s a real hero, a real tough guy, and he\\'ll never let you down, Sean Parnell. Just remember that Conor lamb, and I remember, because he\\'s like a lamb, he\\'s like a little lamb. Weak, got a lot of weak people. We like strong people, don\\'t we? We like strong people. We need strong people right now. We have somebody else in the audience who served as my Secretary of Energy and he was incredible. He was the Governor of Texas for what? 12 years I think. Rick right? 12? Tell me. 14? 14 years he was. And he was an incredible governor, and he was an incredible secretary, and he\\'s been an incredible friend. Rick Perry everybody. There was nobody that got into the race tougher than Rick. What he said about me, I\\'ll never repeat again. Even my own family didn\\'t like me when he got finished. And when he decided that I would be the one, he got out and there\\'s nobody that\\'s said better things about me. But you\\'re great Rick, and you did a fantastic job. Every place you\\'ve been, you\\'ve been great. Thank you very much. Rick Perry. Thank you. Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas? 00, the polls closed and they only announce if you\\'re way ahead. So they say, \"The polls have closed in the great state of Texas, Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas.\" … Hillary even beat this guy. Hillary. Hillary came in second in Utah. This week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from Brazil and from Mexico for the rest of the year despite the USMCA, sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them. So we stopped that. We\\'re reversing decades of the Biden betrayals that decimated Pennsylvania jobs, you know that. This state lost, listen to this, one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organizations, one of the worst things that happened, when China came in. They were flat-lined for many years, then they came into this crazy deal. They\\'re considered a developing nation, you see I\\'ve been sort of protesting that like, but they\\'re considering China as a developing nation, you get all sorts of things that you would never get, advantages over the United States. Well we have very strongly protested that. They\\'re not a developing nation, they\\'re a very powerful developed nation, and you know what? They got to pay what everyone else has to pay. Earlier this year I kept my promise to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well. Everyone said it will never happen, and I had great help from these gentlemen right here. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China\\'s pillaging, plundering and rampant theft of Pennsylvania and many other places, jobs. That\\'s all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by China and others. Joe Biden\\'s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in America. After years and years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, it\\'s called America First. We\\'re America First, that\\'s enough, and we\\'re bringing our soldiers back home. You see what\\'s going on. After 19 years in Afghanistan, far away places, to bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunity zones, Tim Scott, great senator from South Carolina worked on it with me. Passed criminal justice reform, delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that Obama would never do and before the China virus we achieved the lowest African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment rates ever recorded by far. And they\\'re now heading back in that direction quickly. Democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades, they\\'ve failed the Asian community, the Hispanic community. They failed women. The numbers on women\\'s unemployment were the best in 61 years. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the American people. He was always for things that you wouldn\\'t want and now he\\'s changing, \"No, I never said that. I never said that.\" I\\'ve spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African-American community and for all communities and the best is yet to come. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds and on the subject of immigration, we\\'ve been fighting for that. Under my administration we achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we\\'ve deported 20,000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast. Thank you ICE. ICE and Border Patrol. ICE and Border Patrol. They don\\'t like ICE because ICE is, they\\'re tough. You got to be tough in that job by the way. Anybody up here like to work in ICE? I don\\'t think so. Let\\'s see, you could probably be okay but you\\'d rather do what you\\'re doing, right? I agree with you. These are tough guys, they have to be tough. These are bad, bad gang members. I mean you look at MS-13, you look at what\\'s happened with MS-13, you look at … We get them the hell out. Sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don\\'t even want to take a chance, they can come back in after what they\\'ve done, we had thieves, we had some very bad people in the VA and they\\'re all gone. Thank you, I love you too, thank you. Thank you. Such friendly voices. Quite beautiful. Only in Pennsylvania, right? Thank you. I withdrew from the last administration\\'s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, think of this. Obama paid $150 billion for a short-term deal. He gave $1.8 billion in cash. You ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in $100 bills? It\\'s a lot, it\\'s like the size of this, right? Now think $1.8 billion. How did you guys allow that to happen? They said we all voted against it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel. You never know nowadays, right? And I opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They\\'ve been trying to get that done for 52 years, I got it done immediately. By the way, as far as the capital of Israel, Jerusalem, they\\'ve been talking about many, many presidents. They all promised it, nobody did it. I did it. We get things done, and we just did something that is incredible. Even the New York Times gave it good reviews, not good reviews, beyond good reviews. Tom Friedman gave it phenomenal reviews, you believe that? That\\'s we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades, a deal with Israel and the UAE. It\\'s a deal with Israel and the UAE and that\\'s going to lead and I\\'m going to tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we want to get in that deal. You\\'ll have peace in the Middle East. We want to get the hell out. Let\\'s get them all back. Let\\'s get thel all back. Don\\'t forget, we\\'re energy independent. There used to be a reason. Now we do have a reason, it\\'s called Israel, and we have some very good partnerships over there. In all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we\\'re going to take care of those countries, but we are energy independent for the first time and that\\'s a very good feeling. Our military has never been stronger than it is now. It\\'s new and it\\'s beautiful and I told you we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi, and separately, we killed the world\\'s number one terrorist, number one terrorist for decades and decades, Qasem Soleimani. We killed Soleimani. It\\'s a big step for the Middle East. We kept America out of wars. Remember they always said, \"Oh, this Trump. He\\'s radical, he\\'s really, I mean he\\'s off the … He\\'s too radical. He\\'ll get us in wars.\" I kept us out of wars, what happened with North Korea? Look, I get along with Kim Jong-un. They say, \"That\\'s terrible he gets along.\" No it\\'s good if I get along. If I get along with Russia, is that a good thing or a bad thing? I think it\\'s a good thing. These guys only fight to tie, they don\\'t fight to win, you fight to win. You look at what\\'s happening where they\\'re all coming back home. I even reduced in Germany because Germany, they\\'re an ally, but you know, they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military. So we removed a lot of soldiers out of Germany. They\\'re not happy, they said, \"This is going to hurt our economy.\" Well it\\'s good for our economy, okay? They thought it was going to hurt the German economy. Well, they don\\'t treat us right, they don\\'t pay their bills, they\\'re delinquent. You know what delinquent is? They\\'re delinquent. They don\\'t pay their bills. We protect them, they don\\'t pay their bills. We got to do something and they treat us horribly on trade through the European Union which basically they run. Together we\\'ve been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and Biden was there for every one of them. Joe Biden supported NAFTA, China\\'s entry into the World Trade. He supported the Korean deal, the Korean deal was so bad, it was so bad. This was a deal that was going to produce to South Korea done by Crooked Hillary Clinton, this was a deal that was going to produce 250,000 jobs. She said, \" This will be 250,000,\" and she was right, for South Korea. It produced 250,000 jobs. For us, we got nothing. We got losses, we got nothing. It was a terrible deal, I renegotiated, now it\\'s a good deal. They also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Biden supported cutting Social Security. He voted for the Iraq War, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani, when I did that, he said, \"That\\'s a terrible thing. That\\'s a terrible thing.\" Everybody in the Middle East, they couldn\\'t believe it. They celebrated, some of them quite quietly I must add. Sign your mail-in ballot. You sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on Election Day or early voting, that is not tabulated and counted, you go vote, and then if for some reason after that, it shouldn\\'t take that long, it comes in, they\\'re not going to be able to tabulate it because you will have voted. But you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they\\'re going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff. I\\'m trying to be nice. I\\'m trying to be nice. They want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots. Now there have been many races over the last year where they\\'ve done this and they\\'ve been a disaster. You look at New York, they had a congressional race, not a very good congresswoman, very untalented, I know her well, I lived in New York. She\\'s not got much going. They have no idea what the vote is, I think 20% of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said, \"What about me?\" He\\'s not too happy, her opponent. You look at what happened in Paterson, New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia, you look at what happened … There\\'s not a race, and these are small, these are easy to control. they want to send out 80 million unsolicited, I like it much better, they used to say universal, they used to say live ballots, I like the word unsolicited, and solicited. Solicited is okay, because that\\'s when you\\'re asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out, that\\'s okay. But you can\\'t, this whole thing with the unsolicited, unsolicited means you\\'re sitting there. We have a big enthusiasm edge, but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten ballots, they have. Dogs have gotten ballots and they know I\\'m right and everybody knows I\\'m right and they say I\\'m right behind the closed doors and it\\'s a disgrace, what they do to our country. 80 million unsolicited ballots. People that had no idea. People that weren\\'t going to vote in all fairness. It\\'s really unfair because our people have enthusiasm, they\\'re going out to vote. They\\'re all going out to vote. Everybody here going to vote? Everybody? They have no enthusiasm. So I said, \"So that\\'s unfair. That guy walks and then they\\'ll have somebody knock on the door, say, \"Listen, I would like your ballot.\" \"I don\\'t want to vote. I don\\'t care about Biden. I\\'m a Democrat. I don\\'t care about this guy.\" \"Well look, where is it?\" \"Here take it, blah blah blah.\"\" They even have a provision where you don\\'t have to verify signatures. What is going on? And they have another provision in some states where you can harvest, that\\'s where you grab them all together and drop them. In Nevada, they actually have a provision where they don\\'t have to be counted until seven days after the election. So that means if we have a close election, could be close, I hope it\\'s not, I hope we have a landslide like you\\'ve never seen. But if we have a close election that means Nevada has the right to, and I love Nevada, I think we\\'re going to win Nevada, except where they\\'re sending all these hundreds of thousands, millions of unsolicited ballots to people in Nevada and people that probably left a long time ago. It\\'s very unfair, it\\'s very unfair, but think of it. They have seven days after the election. Did you know that Mike? Seven days, what does that mean? I want to see the results of the election on November 3. By the way, if it\\'s anything like these other events, it could go on forever. I mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done, they should make that a do-over and I think in Paterson they have a do-over. I think they\\'re going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud, theft. People were selling ballots, people were selling ballots, and you know they talk about Russia. They\\'re so worried about Russia. What about sending out 80 million ballots? That\\'s your real problem, and if Russia or China or these other countries want to cheat, all they have to do is forge ballots. It\\'s much easier than the way they have to go about it, right? So we have to put pressure on these people. Now the good news is we have a lot of court cases we have won in Pennsylvania, you know that, right? We have two judges, we have a state judge, we have a federal judge. I think both highly qualified judges from what I understand, I hear that they\\'re not too happy about what they\\'re seeing. So we\\'ll see what happens. We\\'re going to see what happens. The lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted, and if it\\'s not counted, vote, and then they have the job, if it comes in late, and if it\\'s not too late, they have the job of making sure that they don\\'t count it. But follow that ballot because these people, they\\'ll be lost, they\\'ll be gone, the numbers are incredible where they\\'re 25 and 30% off, 20% off. Follow your ballot. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. You know that. You know he always gets up today, \"COVID-19, COVID-19.\" I say, \"Joe, look. We got a country,\" and I agree with that and we\\'ve done a hell of a job. We\\'ve done a hell of a job. If you look at some of our numbers. You got to start talking about the economy and you got to start talking, your place, I mean this is … When you look at Pennsylvania, you\\'re in a shutdown. You have a governor that has you shut down we know the susceptible are old people, senior citizens, nursing homes. People that are old, especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes. We know that, we learned it, and we opened it up. But the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems. You remember my original statement, right? The cure can\\'t be greater. It was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it\\'s so true. You have to open up this commonwealth, it has to be opened up. It has to be opened up now. But there\\'s what I think they\\'re doing, because you have the same thing in New York. We have a governor in New York who is 36,000 people died, 11,000 people in a nursing home because he made a mistake. He made a horrible mistake, and I built him a convention center with 2,800 beds and they didn\\'t use it and I sent up a ship, a great hospital ship, a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn\\'t use it and he requested it and then I said, \"You\\'re not using it. Why aren\\'t you using it?\" He could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship. What a shame how long can you do this for? Restaurant, poor guys. You can\\'t, how long can you do this for? The people are going to lose their jobs. They\\'re never going to open again. It\\'s not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world. It\\'s a hard business. New York is closed. You\\'re closed. North Carolina\\'s closed. Michigan\\'s … all Democrats. Let me tell you, what\\'s going to happen on November 4th. They\\'re going to announce their opening. They\\'re doing this for political reasons. They are. Right, John? They\\'re doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible, going into November 3rd, election day. Then as soon as the election\\'s over with, win, lose or draw for them, they\\'re going to open it. They got nothing. You know what? It\\'s a shame what they\\'re doing. For political reasons, they\\'ll be open. You\\'ll be open on November 4th, but you know what? From your standpoint, it\\'s very close to the election. It\\'s very far if you have a restaurant, and you can\\'t open your restaurant. You can\\'t open your store. It\\'s a disgrace and they ought to get together. They ought to do it. These are Democrat governors in all instances and Democrat mayors. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Thanks to the life- saving therapies that we pioneered, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. We\\'ve achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world. You never hear that from the fake news. They don\\'t want to talk to you about it. This is a big country. This is a tougher country to do that with, the European Union\\'s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours. If you look now, Spain is having a big blow up. France is having a big blow up. Now, we\\'ve done a great job, we haven\\'t been given credit for it. He always starts off, COVID-19. That\\'s all he knows. COVID-19. I said, \"What about the economy? What about jobs? What about all the other things we have to do?\" All he does, he thinks it\\'s a weak spot, and actually in theory, if we\\'re getting a fair shake from those people back there, it\\'s actually what the job we\\'ve done is actually a strong spot. That includes you people, with the ventilators that nobody had. Nobody that needed a ventilator, didn\\'t get a ventilator. Now we\\'re supplying them all over the world. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that. You don\\'t hear these numbers. Cases in the US have declined by 28% nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week. Three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials. Would have taken two years for another president. I was going to say a normal president, but they\\'ll hit me with … A little truth to that too. Now, but for another president, especially, in the last administration, they had the H1N1 pandemic. It was called Swine flu. You know, Joe always calls it the N1H1. He gets it mixed up. No, it\\'s the H1N1, Joee. Not that it matters, I guess. No. Do you ever notice, he\\'s always calling it the other. He calls it the opposite. He has no clue where he is, but he keeps saying, \"Oh, if he was,\" well he didn\\'t want the ban China, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning China. I was the only one that wanted to do it, actually. Then we banned Europe because I saw what was happening in Italy and Spain and France. We banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands. If I didn\\'t do the closing and the opening, so we\\'re at 175,000, far too … look, one is too much because this was given to us by China, and it\\'s a disgrace. It\\'s a disgrace. They could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into China, but not going to the rest of the world, including our country. It\\'s a disgrace. But think of it. Joe Biden got the worst marks you\\'ve ever seen for his handling of the H1NI Swine flu. They said it was incompetent, and the head guy, who now he\\'s trying to retract. It\\'s a little tough. That\\'s one great thing about the tape. He said it was horrible. He said, we did a horrible job. He said, they got lucky. It\\'s not contagious like this. We got, this is a tough one. I can look at that guy and he\\'ll catch it. Right there, and he\\'s very far away from me. It\\'s a tough one, because it\\'s so contagious. I tell you what, our Vice-President, Mike Pence, and the task force, headed up by Mike and working along with a lot of great people, they\\'ve done a fantastic job and they just get no credit. If I was a Democrat, a different president, and they did the same job, they\\'d say it was one of the greatest jobs they\\'ve ever seen. But take a look at what they say about the way they handled the Swine flu. It was a disaster. It was incompetent. They called themselves incompetent. They call, and now they\\'re coming in like, well, we would have done this and Biden by the way, was against, you remember, xenophobic, racist, because I closed down China. Then two months later, two and a half, three, and Nancy Pelosi was having dances in Chinatown, right? A month later. No, no problem. I was way ahead. Then Biden comes out and he actually said that I was right, but they said, \"Don\\'t say that, try doing it a little softer than that.\" He did it a little bit softer, but we were right. They were wrong. They handled it so badly. Just take a look, because we, I said to my people, \"We\\'ve got to fight this a little bit differently because we\\'re getting a lot of fake news, a lot of bad people saying things\", and you look at the stats and you look at how we\\'ve done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries, it\\'s amazing. If you took New York out of it, which was a disaster by Cuomo, if you took New York out of those numbers, we would have numbers that would be even better than they are. I could read numbers that would be even much better, because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because New York was incompetently run by Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. By the way, just today, there\\'s another credible thing happening. Pfizer, great company, announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks, very shortly. Incredible. Under Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine, in that record time that we talked about. This would have been years later. It\\'ll be delivered before, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October. How do you like that? Wouldn\\'t that be nice? That would be nice. You know why? Not because of the electric. It\\'ll be nice because we want to save people. That\\'s why it\\'ll be nice. That\\'s the important thing. Together, we will defeat the virus. The job we\\'re doing is, the job that all of the people working on it, our generals, our admirals, the distribution, we bought billions and billions of dollars of things, and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators. Very tough. The ventilator\\'s very complicated, very big, very expensive. It\\'s like, I made the statement, it\\'s like building a car, but more sophisticated. They said, \"No, it\\'s not.\" They said, they took a ventilator. They took it apart. These people are the worst, the worst. Over the next four years, we\\'ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That\\'s what we\\'ll do. Let me just tell you something. If they didn\\'t waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment, based on a phone call that was perfect, this stuff would have all been done. Would have all been done, truly. It would have all been done. Yet, with all of this stuff, the fake Russia witch hunt, the fake Ukraine. How about that? Did anybody read the transcript of that call? It was a perfect call. \"Hey, congratulations. Good luck.\" It was like a perfect call. Now they\\'ll take it back and they\\'ll say, \"Well, I don\\'t know.\" This was a per … In history, there\\'s never been anything like this. It was a totally lopsided, 100% political witch hunt, and it goes on and on. These are bad people. I really believe they don\\'t love our country. I watched Nancy Pelosi. \"You must wear your mask. You have to wear your mask, and we\\'re going to keep every beauty salon closed in California and all over the country.\" Then I see a picture. I say, \"Nancy Pelosi. Well, where\\'s the mask?\" I\\'ll tell you what. She must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly. She uses the salon and the salon turned her in? The salon turned her in. I don\\'t think I would have turned her in. I would\\'ve said, \"Well, you know, she\\'s a customer. I got to take care of my customers, right?\" But she made them open, and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her. How much do they hate Nancy Pelosi? Then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that can\\'t be set up. She said, \"I was set up. I was set up by the salon owner. I was set up.\" I said, \"Tell me she didn\\'t say that, please.\" I just put out, that if she was set up, then she shouldn\\'t be leading the House of Representatives. I want the salon owner to lead the House of Representatives, because she set up … Think of it. She set up the Speaker of the House. That was a big mistake. As soon as I heard, she said, \"Well, she\\'s sent me up,\" Nancy, you\\'re not supposed to get set up. You\\'re representing our country. You know what she should have done honestly? She should have said, \"I made a mistake, sorry,\" and nobody would be talking about, this is like the biggest story. This is the big, crazy Nancy, highly overrated person. Let me just say she is a highly overrated person. They give her such good play. She is a highly overrated person. Look, they just turned off a camera because they don\\'t want me saying that. Just in closing, we will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement. Surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. We will not let them threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. We will end surprise medical billing. We don\\'t want surprise medical billing. You know what happens? It\\'s terrible, but we have ended it. Also, we\\'ve signed something that\\'s incredible. You\\'re going to see. Some people say it\\'s bigger than healthcare, and I signed it. Unfortunately it takes place on January 1st. You better elect me. You better elect me. It\\'s called price transparency. I said to my people at the end of the day, what is price transparency? This is going to lower your prices by 50%. You\\'ll be able to negotiate. You\\'ll be able to do things you\\'re not even allowed to do now, with hospitals, with doctors. You get better doctors, you get lower prices. I said, \"When does it start?\" It\\'s a complicated … Oh, did I get, I was fought. You have no idea. Right fellows? You have fought too. But they fought me on this price transparency. It\\'s bigger than healthcare, could be bigger than healthcare. But I said, \"When does it start?\" They said, \"Sir, we have it all set.\" \"When?\" \"January 1st,\" \"I said, I\\'d better win this election,\" because you\\'re going to see some unbelievable price reductions. That includes on drugs, because we\\'re reducing health insurance premiums massively, and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years, last year. But now it\\'s going to go down very big, because we did a favorite nation\\'s clause. I see the drug companies are, they\\'re killing me with ads. They have nothing but cash. They have nothing but money. They\\'re spending because they can\\'t believe … Germany and other countries pay much less than we do. We want to have, what we have to have, is we have to have a comparison of prices. That\\'s what it is called, favored nation clause. I instituted a favorite, so we\\'re paying $2.50 for a pill, and some nation is paying 25 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory, right? We get the 25 cent price. So, what\\'s going to happen that\\'ll go up. Ours will come way down. They can\\'t believe it. The drug companies can\\'t believe, and I will tell you, Mark Meadows is here, our Chief of Staff. Where\\'s Mark? They want to negotiate. They called. We signed it. It\\'s all done. They want to negotiate and they are negotiating, so let\\'s see what happens, but we\\'re going to get you cuts on prescription drugs, the likes of which you\\'ve never seen. We\\'ll protect Medicare and Social Security. They will not be able to protect it. It will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was dead. Now it\\'s the most vibrant space center in the world, by far. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and we\\'ll teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God, We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania us. It\\'s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington, who, by the way, they want all of the name, Washington removed from everything. I haven\\'t been keeping up with it. What did he do? George Washington, they want the name off. Congressman are we okay showing … I don\\'t think you liked that idea too much. George Washington. They want his name off everything, but we\\'ll keep it. I promise you this. As long as you canceled culture, you better have a strong president. Canceled culture. George Washington, can you believe? But he led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. This is the Commonwealth where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg and where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mined the coal, worked the railroads, forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of world. That\\'s in the history of the world and we are making it greater than it\\'s ever been before. That\\'s what\\'s going to happen. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country from these very, very deranged people. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving like never before. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, and together we will work very hard. The people of Pennsylvania, the great, great people of Pennsylvania, where I went to college. It\\'s a place I know very well. But, we will make America wealthy. Again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania.\\n'"

              "'ell, thank you very much. And hello, Tupelo. This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi. The great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley. But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family and country. Right? Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor, Republican Tate Reeves. Great guy. Great guy. Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before. We\\'re now an economic powerhouse. We\\'ve never been in a position like it. We\\'ve rebuilt our military and we have financial strength. And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401ks, the stock market hit, today, another all-time historic high. Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded. That\\'s not bad. That\\'s not bad when you\\'re on the debate stage and you say, \"We have the best economy we\\'ve ever had. We have the best military we\\'ve ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers we\\'ve ever had.\" Said, \"Got the best president we\\'ve ever had.\" Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Thank you very much. And very importantly, we\\'ve confirmed more than 158 brand new, beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. In a very short while, we\\'ll have 182 federal judges. President Obama left us 142. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Can you believe that? You\\'re supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn\\'t work out too well. And just days ago, the United States brought the world\\'s number one terrorist leader to justice. We have great military. It was very, very depleted. When I came into office, it was very, very depleted, but it ain\\'t depleted anymore. Yep. al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader… Look, you\\'ve heard about it for a long time. I kept saying, \"Where is al-Baghdadi? That\\'s the one I want. Where is he?\" And then, by the way, the following day, we got number two. I don\\'t know if you read about that. But he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and he\\'s dead. And Baghdadi, he was a Savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over. American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell, I guess you could say. He spent his last miserable moments on Earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there going right up. No enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the United States military, and Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you. And our military loves Mississippi. America is winning again, and America is all, over the world, respected again. It\\'s about time. But while we\\'re creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat party has gone completely insane. The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize. We are the ones standing in their way, and we will never get out of their way. It will be easy. From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media right back there… Look at all of them, oh. It\\'s too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn\\'t, they wouldn\\'t be here. Look at how many. It\\'s like the Academy Awards before it failed. Right? And you know why it failed? Because they disrespected us. But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership, trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary. You see what\\'s going on. First, they engineered the Russia hoax. That was a total hoax, the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people. Then the Mueller witch hunt, it never ended. With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget, let\\'s go get him. That didn\\'t work out too well, did it? That fizzled. And a lot of bad people along the way. And now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi- … and shifty Adam Schiff, Shifty. And the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt. This is one I never thought I\\'d be involved in. The word impeachment… To me, it\\'s a dirty word, not a good word. Totally phony deal. They know it. Everybody knows it, and that\\'s why we\\'ve never had greater support than we have right now. It\\'s true. And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside. You\\'ll see a lot more people trying to get in. So if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out. Anybody want to leave? Because there really is. There\\'s no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and to also, at the same time, be very serious than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi. We could have done this one on Monday night. I said, \"Let\\'s do Friday.\" Right? Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They\\'ve been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won. But the people here that are highly sophisticated, though, long before I won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared, \"The campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun.\" At least they gave us 19 minutes. Yesterday\\'s vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself. But I\\'ll tell you, the Republicans are really strong, the strongest I\\'ve ever seen them, the most unified I\\'ve ever seen them. Right? The most unified I\\'ve ever seen them. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism. The Democrats\\' outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020. Make no mistake. They are coming after the Republican party and me because I\\'m fighting for you. They don\\'t like it. This is different. They\\'ve never had anything like this. Well, they\\'ve never had an election like 2016 either, have they? They never have. They\\'ve never quite figured it out. You\\'re the man. And they know they can\\'t win, so let\\'s try and impeach him. How about that crazy representative, Al Green, right? \"You know, we got to impeach him because we can\\'t beat him.\" I don\\'t think so. Right? I don\\'t think so. Al Green, he\\'s another beauty. The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us. And it\\'s not me, it\\'s us. It\\'s all of us. It\\'s 63 million, but it\\'s much more than 63 million. Much more. And right now, our numbers are higher than they\\'ve ever been before. They\\'ve never been this high. But they want to stop us because they know we are here, and that\\'s what we\\'re doing, and that\\'s what\\'s taking up so much time. We\\'re draining the swamp in Washington. Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying… Spying. They actually spied on my campaign. Can you believe it? I mean, you know, they try and say, \"Well, we were actually just checking things out. Oh, that\\'s wonderful.\" The lying, the falsifying over the past three years plus, before I ever even announced they were spying. I guess they knew we were going to win, right? But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed. And remember this, that truth is a force of nature. Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens, just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary\\'s shocking and very many misdeeds. 33,000 emails. 33,000 emails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter\\'s wedding. 33. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. She\\'s a beauty. How about last week? Did you hear? I don\\'t know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing. She\\'s not an agent of Russia. And Jill Stein, she\\'s a greenie. That\\'s fine. We love the environment, everybody in this room. You know, right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we\\'ve ever had, and yet we\\'re number one in the world in energy, by far. We took over. But I don\\'t know Jill Stein. She ran last time. I don\\'t know, but I know she\\'s not an agent of Russia. And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, \"They work for Russia, they\\'re agents of…\" I said, \"You know, when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement.\" She made it about them. Everybody laughed because of what we proved. But I\\'ll tell you what, these are very bad people. These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them. But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle. I\\'ve just beaten, with no… Look, look, we didn\\'t have too much political experience. I did a good job, built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business. Just did one show. It was called The Apprentice, and it was a big success. 14 seasons. And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over. It didn\\'t do too well. It was dead. It was dead from the first episode. I saw him, I said, \"Oh, it\\'s terrible. What have they done to this beautiful show?\" Arnold? But think of it. I\\'ve just beaten, with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack Hussein Obama dynasty. And President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right? He was all over the place. It\\'s the only time I\\'ve actually seen him work hard, when it came to trying to beat Trump. True. True. Remember he said… Remember he said, \"He will not be president\"? Well, that didn\\'t work out so well. And then they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonesty, right, with the lying and the spying and the leaking. And we are kicking their ass. I\\'ll tell you. In the delusional Democrat fantasy, I\\'m now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe. I used to call him 1% because you could never get 1% in the primaries. Then he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became vice president. But we\\'ve now named him Very Slow, Sleepy Joe. Very slow. He\\'s gotten slower and slower. I\\'m afraid if he gets a nomination, he\\'ll be so slow we\\'ll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked Hillary. In fact, I don\\'t even think that Sleepy Joe will get it. But many people are running. So, you know, it\\'s so early. I don\\'t want to talk about their campaign. Oh, did you hear Beto? Beto? Did you hear Beto? Beto. Oh, that poor bastard. Well, poor, pathetic guy. He was pathetic. Remember the arms a-flailing? Remember that? You know, he ran against Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won. He spent almost 100 million dollars, and Ted Cruz… And I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good. But I used to watch him. Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables. He was standing on countertops. I said, \"Does he ever stand on the floor and speak?\" But he\\'s waving his arms and going crazy, and I said, \"What the hell is he doing? What is he on?\" And do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this? Anybody that says he was born for this, they\\'re in trouble. I used to have guys come into my office, \"Sir, I\\'m the greatest salesman. Nobody can sell…\" You know, the truth is anybody that says they\\'re a great salesman, usually they\\'re not a very good salesman. It\\'s true. It\\'s those sneaky ones in the back that don\\'t talk, that you don\\'t know about. They\\'re the ones. But Beto was nasty, and he said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven. He came down. And if that\\'s the case, some really bad things happen, because he made a total fool out of himself. And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas. He came out of Texas, a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be. So he was a nasty guy, but he had a couple of policies that don\\'t work well in the state of Texas. Right? He was against religion. He was against you having a gun. And he was against oil. So you come from Texas, you don\\'t like religion, you don\\'t like oil, and you don\\'t have guns. I don\\'t know. That\\'s not a good combination in the state of Texas. That\\'s not good in Mississippi, either. I don\\'t know it\\'s that good anywhere. Nah, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully we won\\'t be hearing about him for a long time. It\\'s amazing how cold you could get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy. But in the twist… Oh, Alabama. Love Alabama. I love Alabama. I love Alabama. It\\'s a great place. But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush and that means Clinton and that means Obama, they have me supposedly saying to myself, \"Well, let\\'s see. I got a guy named Sleepy Joe Biden. How do I beat him? How do I beat him? How do I beat this guy? He\\'s such a great.\" Clinton, she was easy. Right? Obama was easy. The Bush dynasty was. But sleepy Joe, I\\'m worried about, right? So then I said to myself, \"Gee, I guess there\\'s only one way. Let\\'s call up Ukraine for help. These people are sick. These people are sick. Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and they\\'ll put it, because they\\'re so damn dishonest, and they\\'ll just say- … \"Let\\'s use Ukraine for help.\" That\\'s what they\\'re going to say. And they won\\'t show the laughter, and they won\\'t show the sarcasm, and they won\\'t show the fun because they\\'re the most dishonorable people almost on earth. It\\'s a disgrace. But we say it anyway. And here\\'s the good news. The people get it. So they have a brand new president in Ukraine. Good guy, by the way. And I call a brand new person, a man I have no idea who he is, and I\\'m on a phone, right? And I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country, many people listen. And I\\'m on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new president, just got there, called to congratulate him, \"Please, could you help me please?\" I don\\'t know who he is. I didn\\'t know his name until I looked down the card, I see. And he\\'s a nice guy, and hopefully he\\'s going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems. And one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption. But the other reason… Why isn\\'t Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there… Why aren\\'t they doing things that they\\'re supposed to do? Why is it always the United States? So I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect. It was perfect. It wasn\\'t like almost… It was perfect. It was totally appropriate. I made it at the behest of people to say, \"Could you call and say hello?\" Now I\\'m an honest person, anyway. But do you think, when I\\'m making a call to a newly-elected president of a country, that I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening on the line? Many people. Whoever the hell wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people. And remember, the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America, the president. I guarantee he\\'s got a lot of people listening, too. These people are sick.  no pressure. They must think we\\'re nuts, to be honest. It\\'s all a phony deal, this whole impeachment scam, to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections, maybe the greatest … I mean, let\\'s give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we\\'ve ever had. So my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don\\'t quit. But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of Sleepy Joe. So I quote, \"I said\" … Let me act like him. I\\'ve got to speak really slow though, and … \"I said, ‘You\\'re not getting a billion.\\' I looked at them and I said, ‘I\\'m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor isn\\'t fired, you\\'re not getting the money. You understand? You\\'re not getting the money.\\'\" Then he goes, at the end … I didn\\'t know he had this kind of energy. He goes, \"Well, son of a bitch, he got fired.\" You know, in a certain way, I was impressed because, I mean, I didn\\'t think he had the energy, the brain power. It\\'s turned out he doesn\\'t. By the way, he\\'s dropping like a rock. When you\\'re at 1%, there\\'s always a reason. He should be there fairly soon. As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold, I think it was $1 billion or something in aid, was the prosecutor investigating his son\\'s company, that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy just got thrown out of the Navy … He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy. He knew less about it than this young … How old are you? Six. This young, beautiful person in front of me. Six. And this young six-year-old is smarter, so I think I\\'d basically go with her. So what is it all about? It\\'s called a payoff, but you know what? The fake news, they apologize. I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper. Well, the hatred, I mean, between him and Fredo. You\\'ve got Fredo and … That\\'s Cuomo, Fredo. I call him Fredo, like from the movie. Now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden. The good news is Biden didn\\'t know too much about what the hell he was talking about. Remember Biden said, \"I don\\'t know these people. I don\\'t know them. I don\\'t know them.\"  we\\'re dealing with life, right? He never spoke to him. Unfortunately, the next day … In the world of the internet, in the world of smart people … That\\'s why I like Beto, he wasn\\'t smart, couldn\\'t handle it. I told my wife, I said, \"See, it\\'s not so easy.\" I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love. They love her. When Beto quit, he quit like a dog. When he quit I said, \"See, people think this is easy. This isn\\'t easy,\" but it just worked out that way. But Biden said, \"I never met the people, never met the gentlemen.\" Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they\\'re playing golf together, but he never met him. So now you\\'ll ask him, he\\'ll say, \"No, we played around a golf. We were together for three hours. I never mentioned the fact that they\\'re paying my son millions.\" Oh, no, no, no. … Well, they might be watching us. I guess they do watch us. He used to interview me. He was so nice. Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me. It was like they were love fests, but I don\\'t want anything to do with him. They were love fests. What a thought. He\\'s weak. He\\'s a weak person, but they\\'re all weak. But let me just tell you something. We need honesty with our media. We need honesty, because the New York Times, the Washington Post … And by the way, I don\\'t know, you probably read it. We threw them out at the White House. We don\\'t show them anymore. If somebody wants to go and buy them; we threw them out. And they came into my office and then I got to get back to this guy. Where\\'s Hunter? Where\\'s Hunter? We had a tee shirt made, \"Where\\'s Hunter? Where\\'s Hunter?\" Poor Hunter. He then came out, he did the Morning Show. That was the last we\\'ve seen of Hunter. That wasn\\'t good. The morning of his father\\'s very bad debate, but it\\'s, where is Hunter? But before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while, we got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times. We got rid of them, right? We don\\'t have them in the White House. I said, \"No, you could … People can go out and buy them, but we don\\'t\" … We used to have them stacked up, and I\\'d go in and I\\'d see a meeting with my people and they\\'re dealing with China, South Korea, or somebody. And I\\'d go into these offices; I\\'d see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. I keep trying to figure out who\\'s worse. And one day it\\'s the Times, one day it\\'s the Post. It\\'s like top each other, they\\'re so bad. It\\'s so phony. In my opinion, it\\'s virtually corrupt. I\\'ve never seen it. You never have a good story. I mean, even when we got al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric. Where did that come from? The other thing, if Obama would have done it … because, look. This guy built ISIS. The caliphate, it was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio. That\\'s a big, lot of land. 7 million people, and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits. I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were … How can you be happy? But they were so thrilled that we got this animal. They were so thrilled. But you know what? And you know what? We don\\'t do it for … We do it because it\\'s right. That story was a massive story. That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest, ever. Bigger than anything. That story disappeared so fast. Done. And that\\'s okay. I didn\\'t do it for the story. I did it because it\\'s the right thing to do. But if I were a Democrat, they\\'d be talking about that story for weeks. With me, they don\\'t even want to … They actually played it down. And actually, and I\\'m happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me. And I\\'m very happy with that. I\\'m very … Conan is incredible. And Conan\\'s coming to the White House in a few weeks. But it is true. Did you ever see a story disappear so fast? I mean, if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months. They\\'d be talking about his bravery. Oh, so bravery. But again, 142 judges he gave us. Remember that. How can you be a great … They always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges. We got two Supreme Courts. Great ones. Great judge. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges. By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-Justice Kavanaugh? Did anybody ever? Was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with? Anyway, just to finish. So Hunter then goes to China. Now I\\'m dealing with China right now. They don\\'t like me too much. They dream about the day when somebody else … And would they like to have … How about this? You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, too, you give him $1.5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street can\\'t get it. He walks out with $1.5 billion. And then there are other places also, I understand. Folks, it\\'s disgraceful that the press doesn\\'t cover it for what it is. It\\'s a payoff. It\\'s a payoff. And how would you like to have Sleepy Joe, with the son getting all of this money from China, become president and take over the China deal? They are not liking me. They had the worst year that they\\'ve had in 57 years. Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars. We\\'re taking billions and billions of dollars, and you know what we\\'re doing with some of it? Just a small portion, but 100%, they\\'re taking care of … Our farmers got $16 billion last year and $12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers, because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers. So they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing. And they thought our farmers would say, \"Oh, we don\\'t like Trump.\" They did just the opposite. They said, \"We know he\\'s doing the right thing because we\\'ve been ripped off for so many years.\" But I said to him, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Purdue, a great guy; I said, \"Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product?\" He said, \"Sir, $16 billion.\" I said, \"Good, I\\'ll make it up.\" And we\\'re going to have a lot leftover. So we will have, pretty soon, over $100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents. They only took. They only took. So when I said to the farmers, \"We\\'re going to send you $16 billion, and it\\'s already been sent. And it\\'s been split into $12 billion the year before.\" I mean, think of that, $28 billion. I said, \"Compliments of China.\" And we had a lot left over. Not bad, right? Not bad. You think Obama would do that? I don\\'t think so. You think Hillary would do that? I don\\'t think so. You think Sleepy Joe would do that? I don\\'t think so. He wouldn\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message. It\\'s very important for this reason, as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst. But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption. They\\'re corrupt. Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician. You know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it, I said, \"Oh, I\\'m going to sue him.\" They said, \"Sir, I\\'m sorry. You can\\'t.\" He\\'s got total immunity because he made it in Congress. Can you believe this? But here\\'s the good news. At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what\\'s going on. A bunch of phony people, but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great, new Republican … Right? Republican governor, right? Hey, he\\'s a great guy, too. And all I know is he\\'s loved and respected by your current governor, because Phil is some piece of work. Phil is so confident. I wanted Phil to run for a certain office, then I wanted him to do something. I\\'ve tried to get him, but some guys are confident. Phil said, \"No sir, I\\'ve been doing this all my life. I love the people.\" He built the most beautiful African-American museum. Phil, he\\'s the greatest, but he built the most beautiful … But he\\'s got confidence. And he said, \"No sir, I\\'d been doing it. I don\\'t really want to do that.\" In other words, he said, \"That\\'s enough.\" … Oh, we love our police, right? I love our police. We love our police. He\\'ll oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible. They\\'re terrible. And Tate will always defend your Second Amendment. So Tate\\'s running against a liberal Democrat named Jim Hood. Now all I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama. Isn\\'t that nice? He wanted Obama to win so badly and then he wanted Hillary to win. And that\\'s not the kind of guy we need here. Not in Mississippi. He\\'s supported by extreme leftists like Stacey Abrams, who, by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp. And they came in with … Oh, they brought them all. They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey. They came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won. We won, fairly easily. But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote. Do you believe this? I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education. They want to give them this. They want to give them free healthcare. They want to give these people, that come into our country illegally all benefits, and he opposed our travel ban, which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country. And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense. If you don\\'t want a far left Democrat running Mississippi … Wait a minute. How\\'s this guy? I can\\'t believe this is a competitive race. It\\'s embarrassing. I\\'m talking to Mississippi. I\\'m talking to Mississippi. I can\\'t believe it. I don\\'t think that he\\'s going to be the right guy. I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves. He\\'s going to be fantastic. He will be a great, great governor. Tate, come on up. Tate. Thank you, Tate. Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate. He\\'ll never let you down. And don\\'t kid yourself. Your Second Amendment is under attack, but not with him. It\\'s under attack. So we\\'re also joined tonight by a man who is truly, and I\\'ve sort of said it a lot, but he\\'s been a great governor and he loves your state. He loves the people of this great state, Governor Phil Bryant. Where\\'s Phil? Come up, Phil. Come up. Oh, he\\'s central casting. Look at him. Come here, Phil. Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Thank you, my Phil. What a job. What a great job. You have to continue that whole thing going forward. So another man who\\'s a warrior is a friend of mine. Whenever there\\'s a problem, he\\'s there. He\\'s always there. He\\'ll be right at the front. He is tough. He is smart. He\\'s brilliant, actually. And he loves this state and he loves you people. Senator Roger Wicker. Roger. Thanks, Roger. Thank you, Roger. And somebody, I\\'ll call her up because, believe it or not, she\\'s running with me. She just ran. I said, \"Cindy, you just ran. You just won.\" She said, \"No, I have to do it again.\" She\\'s running in 2020. I thought she\\'d have six years. I said, \"Cindy, it\\'s only like a year.\" Cindy Hyde-Smith. She\\'s incredible. She\\'s tough and smart and strong, and she\\'s with us all the way. Cindy Hyde-Smith.  Trent Kelly, Michael Guest. Incredible people. And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann. Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch. Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson. Great people. Your next State Treasure, David McRae. State Auditor, Shad White. Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gipson. Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney. And former governor, a man that nobody\\'s ever heard of in this room, I\\'m sure, but the truth is he\\'s a legend in politics and a great guy. He\\'s a great guy, Haley Barbour. … Hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country. Under my administration, we\\'ve already added nearly 10,000 new factories, and many more are coming in as we speak. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average $2,000 to $2,500 per family, bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores. What\\'s happening? You couldn\\'t get the money. The big companies, they couldn\\'t get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint. They brought back almost $1 trillion now because of us. All put to work. We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy. We are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world. For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals. Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization. Two of the worst deals ever made by our country. 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that, and that\\'s awful, and a big price to pay for Washington\\'s disloyalty to the American worker. That\\'s what it was. It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons. But now you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am. I\\'m a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity. We\\'re stopping China from ripping us off. We\\'re stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories. That\\'s not happening anymore. It\\'s reversed. We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore, and they all know it. We\\'re replacing NAFTA … and that was a disaster, NAFTA … with the brand new US, Mexico, Canada agreement if Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable. Nervous Nancy, she doesn\\'t want to give the people of our country a victory. She\\'s very busy doing other things. Having fun. The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi\\'s farmers and also includes powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else. It\\'s a great agreement. About time we got rid of NAFTA. The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now. The last administration\\'s horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the US auto industry, but I proudly, first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity. Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a $170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility … did you ever hear of this place … Blue Springs. Blue Springs. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world. We take care of other people. We take care of other countries, but we don\\'t take care of our own. They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. They deployed our military to protect … think of this … immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. I ask those wealthy nations now, I respectfully the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, \"King, we\\'re going to help you, but you\\'ve got to pay.\" And he was great. No, he was great. He was great. He said, \"But nobody has ever asked before.\" I said, \"But I\\'m asking.\" And billions of dollars will come in, and we\\'re protecting a great ally. We have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things. But we said, \"You\\'re very wealthy. You have to pay,\" and they\\'re going to pay. And that\\'s true with many countries by the way. That\\'s true with many countries. They never respected us. They could never believe it. I said to one country … I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan. I said to Prime Minister, I said, \"How did you get away with this for so long?\" And he looked at me and he couldn\\'t really answer it because how the hell did this happen? We\\'re protecting 94 countries. Ask China, \"How many countries are you protecting President Xi?\" And they look at me like, \"What a stupid question. We protect one. China.\" You ask President Putin, \"How many countries are you protecting President Putin?\" And he looks and he goes, \"Russia.\" You ask other countries … we\\'re protecting at least 94. In fact, so many they can\\'t even tell me. I\\'ve been trying to get an answer for four months. So many they can\\'t even tell. It\\'s crazy, but it\\'s all beautiful the way it\\'s happening. A lot of good things are happening. But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay. Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you, to take your money, to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth all over the globe, wherever they wanted it. But I don\\'t like that. I don\\'t like that. The great sellout has ended, and it ended the day I took the oath of office. That was quite a day. After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation. We are finally putting America first. Our policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests. It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policemen of the world. Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood. Not one drop. Actually, I have to be honest. One soldier stepped on a nail. That\\'s true. I said, \"Don\\'t tell the press that because they\\'ll say, but one soldier stepped in a nail.\" I said, \"How bad was it?\" \"It\\'s okay.\" I said, \"Don\\'t mention it please.\" They always like to mention exactly what happened. You can take it a little bit low key. Stepped on a nail. Not a drop of blood. And we don\\'t have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria. They\\'ve been fighting for 1000 years. But what we do is we did keep the oil, if you don\\'t mind. We kept the oil. We kept the oil. And we\\'ll distribute that oil, we\\'ll help out the Kurds, and we\\'ll help out other people. We\\'ll also help out ourselves if that\\'s okay. Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very, very dangerous war zones. Then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions. I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think so. We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here. We don\\'t want to do that. To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures. Toughest ever that we\\'ve ever had. No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats. They want open borders, which mean crime. They want sanctuary cities, which means crime and drugs and death. After bleeding the middle class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels. Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities. We are now building a wall. We\\'re building it. We\\'re building it. And you think that was easy? The Democrats, they didn\\'t want that wall. I got money for everything, but when it came to the wall, not 25 cents. Not 25 cents. But we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here, we took it from there. Or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases. We\\'re winning cases now. Winning a lot of cases. But the wall is going up rapidly. It\\'s going up rapidly. And this is a very serious wall. This is the exact everything they wanted. I went to the border patrol, incredible people and ICE. Incredible people, tough people. They love our country. And I said, \"Give me the specifications for the wall.\" They said, \"Well sir, we\\'d like steel, but would also like concrete and would also like rebar.\" I said, \"Well, what do you want? Which one?\" So I did all three because it\\'s a different form of cutting. You can cut through steel, but you can\\'t through the concrete and then you can\\'t through the hardened rebar. We got it all. \"And we also need see-through, sir. Got to see who\\'s on the other side.\" That makes sense, right? Not just concrete. It\\'s more expensive what we\\'re doing, but we\\'re giving and we\\'re building … we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It\\'s going up fast. In all the right areas. In all the right areas. That was a tough one. And the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out. They\\'re great. Great people. We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country. And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern Border, tough place, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May, and we are faster than ever securing the Southern Border. And soon it will be, when the wall is completed, secure like it\\'s never been before. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders. 27,000. You know what that is? And they are keeping people out. And I want to thank the President of Mexico. He\\'s an excellent person, great man. And we appreciate it. And the reason is that our Democrats won\\'t even approve things called loopholes. They\\'re loopholes. That\\'s a horrible name, right? That means it\\'s a loophole. That means you can come in illegally and lots of things. Catch and release. You catch them. Then you\\'ve got to release them. By law you\\'ve got to release them or they\\'ll arrest the border patrol agent if they don\\'t release. It\\'s crazy. But we could end this in 15 minutes, but they don\\'t want to do it. They don\\'t want to do it. They\\'re obstructionists. They\\'re colluders. And we can\\'t let it happen. That\\'s why you have to go with Tate Reeves. Tate\\'s going to send a big signal, by the way. It\\'s a big signal. It\\'s great for you. He\\'s going to be a great governor. It also sends a big signal to these radical left, crazy Democrats. It\\'s very important that Tate wins. Very important. We\\'re also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said, \"We\\'re not going to have them,\" and Roger Wicker said, \"We\\'re not going to have them. And Cindy said, \"We\\'re not going to have them.\" Democrats\\' sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE … and they are heroes, I wouldn\\'t want their job. MS-13, they walk right into those nests … they call them a nest … and they start swinging. You never saw anything like it. I\\'ll say, \"You know what? Better you than me.\" Let\\'s see who would do good. He\\'d do good. That guy. That guy would do good. Most of you wouldn\\'t do too good. No. I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country. Who would do it? They\\'re moving thousands of people from MS-13. These gangs are the worst people. These people, these are not human beings. You know, I said that once before and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said, \"How dare you say they\\'re not human?\" You ever see these people? And they slice people up with a knife because it\\'s more painful than using a gun. And then I have to defend myself when I say they\\'re animals. But you know what? I never changed. I didn\\'t say, \"Oh, I\\'d like to apologize. I\\'d like to apologize. Crazy Nancy.\" And you got to look at her district in San Francisco. She\\'s spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff. Take a look at what\\'s happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco. It\\'s thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods. Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy. Go home and fix your district. Go home and fix your district. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and border patrol, vote for Tate Reeves. Tuesday. Got to get out. You got to get out. Got to send the signal. Let it be a big victory too. The Democrat party has never been more extreme, you know that, than it is today. The Democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate Medicare. I will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. We\\'ll always take care of them. Virtually every Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the moment of birth. Well, the governor of Virginia executed a baby. Remember that whole thing. After birth, after birth. Some people never heard of it. He said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother. Nobody ever heard that. That is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream. Nobody has done more for the African American community than the Republican party. And we\\'re also the party of Abraham Lincoln. We can\\'t forget that. People forget. Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe. To lift up distressed communities, we created opportunities zones. So incredible. So successful. Including 100 new opportunity zones right now in Mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix. And Tim Scott, I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina choices. They can go out, get a doctor, we pay the bill, and they don\\'t have to wait six weeks, four weeks, two weeks. We had people waiting in line. They weren\\'t very sick. By the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. Now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans. The great rebuilding of the American Armed Forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville. And Roger has been fantastic. And Cindy Hyde-Smith has been fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To protect America\\'s security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It\\'s not the same country anymore. Nothing\\'s easy, but it\\'s not the same. And I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. For years you watch as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi. The next step to victory begins on Tuesday right here in your great state. With your support we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history. And you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high, it\\'s … I will tell you something … if we didn\\'t win this election, that stock market would be in one-half. It was heading in the wrong direction. It was going to fail. And if they ever did anything bad, if they ever do anything bad to us, if they ever succeed in their wildest dream, which will never let them happen, that stock market will crash like you\\'ve never seen a crash before. And you will not be happy with your 401ks like you\\'re happy right now because they don\\'t know what they\\'re doing. They don\\'t know what they\\'re doing. And I\\'d like to speak well, but the leadership, they have no clue. They\\'re just very vicious people. Actually, they\\'re sort of mentally violent people, but we\\'ve got it under control. It always helps when you didn\\'t do anything wrong. I always say, \"How do you impeach a President who didn\\'t do anything wrong?\" So we\\'re going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson. On Tuesday, you\\'re going to get out and you\\'re going to vote, and you\\'re going to give up whatever you have to give up. You\\'re going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late. Tell your boss I said it was okay. I will give you a pardon if I have to. I\\'ll give you a one-hour pardon. But with your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. And you have great congressmen here and I\\'ll tell you, I want to appreciate it, fellas. Warriors, you\\'re warriors. You are warriors. What was it? 196 for and nothing against, right? That doesn\\'t happen with Republicans. It doesn\\'t happen. I always complain. I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians. They have lousy policies. Open borders, sanctuary cities, but they have one thing. They stick together and they\\'re vicious. The Republicans have great policy. In many ways they\\'re better politicians, but they\\'re not as vicious. Thank you, darling. I appreciate it. They\\'re not as vicious, but they have a tendency to split apart. The Democrats don\\'t seem to have any Mitt Romneys. We do. We do. I don\\'t know. Maybe he\\'ll get better. Maybe he\\'ll get better. We\\'ll see. We\\'ll see what happens. Maybe he\\'ll get better. Just let it be fair, but they don\\'t have that. We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, ‘Made in the USA.\\' Made in America. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Can you believe that? Within 10 years it will be over. When they told me that, I said, \"That\\'s incredible.\" We\\'re going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years. It\\'s funded. Nobody would have thought we could do that, but we\\'re doing it. We\\'ll have it ended in America in 10 years. The AIDS epidemic. Who would\\'ve thought? We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and we always will. You\\'ll never see it disappear. In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, pioneered technology, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And today it\\'s greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. That\\'s what we\\'re doing. That\\'s what happened in 2016. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We\\'ll get so tired of winning. I don\\'t know, Mississippi. You\\'re winning. You had the best year you\\'ve ever had. You have the best, Mississippi, the best year you\\'ve ever had in the history of our country. Mississippi. Your statistic. Mississippi, aren\\'t you getting tired of winning? I guess not. So Phil doesn\\'t come to me and say, \"Sir, please, we\\'re willing too much. The people of Mississippi can\\'t take it anymore.\" I don\\'t think you\\'ll ever have to make that trip. I don\\'t think he\\'s ever going to have to, and I don\\'t think Tate will ever have to make that trip. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Mississippi. Thank you.\\nI want to thank you very much. North Carolina, thank you very much. I\\'m thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte, where, by the way, we\\'re having our convention. I guess you heard that, right? With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now, we\\'re going to defeat the radical socialists. We\\'re going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide. We won it last time, we\\'re going to win it this time by even more. And you know, Eric and Lara named their daughter, you know what her name is? Carolina, Carolina. Her name is Carolina for a reason. This is an incredible time for our nation. Our country is stronger than ever before. And today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. That\\'s great. That\\'s great. That was great. You know, our opponents were saying, \" Oh, maybe he\\'s in trouble, maybe the economy … \" They\\'ll do anything. They\\'ll do anything. I\\'m sure they were thrilled. Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today? I don\\'t think so. By the way, look at this. Look back there, look at all of that press. Look at all them. Man, I don\\'t know if Sleepy Joe, or Bernie, I don\\'t think they have that much press. Bernie was going wild. Why would I be here tonight? Why would I be here? He said why would I be here tonight? We don\\'t have the primary, we\\'ve already won the thing, you know? I was going to say the you know what thing, I held it back, because they\\'ll say, \"Horrible language. He used horrible language today.\" But we\\'re doing fantastically. There\\'s never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now. Never, never. And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie, and that\\'s true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too. And there\\'s not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he\\'s running for the Senate. I looked at the First Lady, I said, \" Hey, he\\'s running for the Senate.\" And today he just said Super Thursday, he\\'s looking forward to Super Thursday. Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military. Every day, for me and for you, it\\'s promises made, promises kept. One of the most important promises I made is right to this era. You know, we look at it, it\\'s the never ending wars in the Middle East. We\\'re taking our soldiers, we\\'re bringing them back home. We\\'re not law enforcement. We\\'re bringing them back home. American troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don\\'t want it. The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country. Two days ago, the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens And all of the things that we\\'ve done, we\\'ve wiped out the terrorists, we\\'ve done so much, and you know what? We\\'re 8,000 miles away. You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan, you\\'ve got Afghanistan itself. The progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. You know that. We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice. As we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place. They\\'re not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them. We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. By the way, I have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas, any one of them, Sleepy Joe, he doesn\\'t have that, so he doesn\\'t have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd. They never say that. Hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. Right now. Spin them around. No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally, but do we have a great time at a Trump rally? My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus. You know about this whole thing? Horrible. Including, sweeping travel restrictions. Today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and they\\'re really working hard, and they\\'re working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. They\\'re going to have vaccines I think relatively soon. And they\\'re going to have something that makes you better, and that\\'s going to actually take place we think even sooner. So a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. We went out, we\\'re doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. We\\'re working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world? I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. And we\\'re working with other countries. In all fairness, look, it\\'s a problem, we\\'re working with other countries. Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right? From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. Think of it, 27,000. You lose 27,000 people to the common flu. It can be much more. One year was much higher than the 70,000 number. Those people died. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn\\'t know that. Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, \"What do we lose with the regular flu?\" They said, \"About 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people.\" I said, \"Nobody told me that. Nobody knows that.\" Last year was approximately 36,000 people died. So we\\'re working hard on it, and we\\'re going to come up with some really great solutions. In the meantime, we\\'re stopping … Only in North Carolina. Only in North Carolina. It can only be. How many people here are from South Carolina, by the way? All right, we love both places. But that was from North Carolina. But just to finish up, so we\\'ve made a lot of progress, we\\'ve really done a great job with it. We\\'re keeping our borders strong. My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that\\'s what I\\'ll do. Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. But honestly, not so much anymore. Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. We\\'re actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. So we have our professionals in constant touch, I\\'m in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop. We\\'ve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. We\\'re going to safeguard our people, the United States. The United States is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness. Earlier today, when I met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly. The media didn\\'t know. Nobody knew. They\\'ve never heard this before. And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. Who knows what happened, but we\\'re going to reduce and the severity of what\\'s happening, the duration of the virus. We discussed all of these things. We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible. And I have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, America is so resilient, we know what we\\'re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth. We have the greatest health system on earth. The renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion. No country is better equipped than America to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than Americans. And together, we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That\\'s what it is. Last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in January alone. That makes seven million jobs since the election. We have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He is dead. And we took out the world\\'s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, Soleimani. While the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up American citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday. No, he said, \"Super Thursday.\" You can\\'t do these things. Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday? It would be over, right? I would be over. No matter how good you are at certain things, you can\\'t, as an example, a name like Sleepy Joe, he\\'s constantly naming the wrong state. \"It\\'s great to be in the state of Ohio.\" No, no, no, I\\'m sorry, you\\'re in North Carolina. No, no. Joe! Do you ever see them run up with a sign, \"No, no, North Carolina, Joe!\" Once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because it\\'s a disaster no matter how good you\\'re doing. We\\'re in North Carolina! It\\'s great to be in Idaho! No, you\\'re in Iowa. Nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, they\\'re a little scary? We\\'re going to protect your second amendment, you understand that. But did you see, Sleepy Joe, did you see Sleepy Joe, where he said, \"Last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country.\" 150 million! That means 50% of our country. That\\'s a big story. 150. Can you imagine Trump saying that? These people would never let me live it down. We can\\'t make even a little mistake. We can\\'t make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake. If we make a tiny mistake, it\\'s headlining. They say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say Super Thursday, they say Georgia, he\\'s looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow. Georgia\\'s not in Super Tuesday! So many mistakes! You can\\'t do that when you\\'re negotiating with China. Can\\'t do that when you\\'re negotiating with these countries, can you? Those mistakes would be very tremendous. Then you have Mini Mike. You see this guy? Can you believe it? Mini Mike. He\\'s being interviewed tonight on Fox. Can you believe it? Fox. They want to be politically correct. They want to interview, they end up interviewing more Democrats than Republic … I don\\'t know what\\'s going on with Fox. But they\\'re interviewing this guy the night before … Mini Mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is. The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history. The worst in history. Nah, I got to have more. I\\'d get down real low, but I don\\'t want to copy him. Everybody saw it. Everyone said, \"Oh,\" they all say, \"Oh! Do that again where you get down low.\" But if I do that again, it\\'s a copy. It\\'s a copy! No, no. No. You never like to copy, even though you\\'re copying yourself. You don\\'t like to copy. You do it once. It was a big hit. But you do it once, and you sort of say, \"That was nice, don\\'t do it again,\" because if it doesn\\'t work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right? Right? We all know. But no, he\\'s a disaster waiting to happen. He\\'s a mess. No matter which Democrat candidate you\\'re talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates … And you see what\\'s happening, right? It\\'s being rigged against … It\\'s sad. It\\'s being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy. Crazy. I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they\\'re doing. I called it a long time ago. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Buttigieg, May Pete, he quit. Out last night. Then I hear a Senator from a state we\\'re going to win, we\\'re going to win that state, but she dropped out. Sounds like they made a deal. They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo, that\\'s why. Don\\'t care. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo, they made a deal. Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo. But they\\'ve embraced an extreme left wing agenda. Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty. You know that. The Democrat Party has gone crazy. Whether it\\'s Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Pocahontas\\'s plan … By the way, she\\'s history. She\\'s history. I came up with that name far too early, I should\\'ve just waited. But it didn\\'t matter. I thought she was making a come back. I said, \"Wow, I just did it to her.\" But you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago? They never caught on. In fact, she\\'ll probably lose the State of Massachusetts to Bernie. So she doesn\\'t know what to do because you\\'re not supposed to lose the State of Massachusetts if you get in there. She\\'s the Senator. She\\'s the Senator for Massachusetts, I think she\\'s going to lose it to Bernie. And Miss Michigan, you see what\\'s going on over there? Michigan, we\\'re leading. We\\'re leading in Wisconsin. We\\'re leading in Florida. We\\'re leading in the last election. Hey, how great was the 2016 election? One of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television. And remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one. This is going to be… oh, that wasn\\'t so easy for them. I love the scene. The scene of that convention center where Hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost. But Elizabeth Warren\\'s here to plan to eliminate our borders, or Mini Mike\\'s plan to eliminate your second amendment. Mike Bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment. Don\\'t worry about it, it\\'s not going to happen. Not going to happen for him. For sleepy Joe, he doesn\\'t even know where he is, what he\\'s doing, or what office he\\'s running for. Actually, I honestly don\\'t think he knows what office he\\'s running for. And it doesn\\'t matter. Maybe he gets in, because he\\'s a little more moderate. So maybe he gets in. But he\\'s not going to be running it. Other people are going to. They\\'re going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. But they\\'re going to be super left radical crazies. They\\'re going to be super left radical crazies, Joe\\'s going to be in a home. He\\'ll be watching television. Everything will be just fine. The insanity of Washington Democrats is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican party. We have the enthusiasm in our party. No, I really mean it. I constantly hear about the enthusiasm. They\\'re fighting each other, they hate each other, they don\\'t know what\\'s going on. We have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what we\\'re doing. We know what we\\'re doing. So we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors. Even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, he\\'s become a great friend of mine. What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that? One of the greatest statements ever made in the United State\\'s Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham. Come on up, Lindsey. Lindsey Graham, come on up, Lindsey. Come here, Lindsey. I got to have him say something, come here, Lindsey, great guy. They handle pressure so well. They came and we gave a rally that was like this and Dan Bishop and Gregg Murphy won by so much, it wasn\\'t even close. They\\'re great people, and they\\'ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. They handle pressure. They were under a lot of pressure, they handled it well. It\\'s nice to know people can handle pressure, there aren\\'t too many of them. North Carolina Republican party chairman Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael. I have a few great friends of mine and they love North Carolina. Louis DeJoy, who you know, Louis DeJoy. Two great people, diamond and silk. Right? Diamond and silk. We love them. You know the first lady, a long time ago now, right? How long is that? Probably almost almost five years ago, she said, \"There are these two women on the internet, they\\'re unbelievable. They\\'re unbelievable.\" I said, \"Oh, I know, I hear that all the time. I hear it all the time.\" She said, the next day she came again. She said, \"I saw them again, they\\'re unbelievable.\" I said, \"Let me see.\" I saw them, I fell in love with it, and everybody fell in love with Diamond and Silk. So thank you. Some people that have really been helpful to me, Corey Lewandowski, David Bussey, and Pam Bondi, right here. Thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 Republican National Convention right here in Charlotte an outstanding success, RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co chairman Tommy Hicks, and Convention president Marcia Lee Kelly, thank you all. You\\'re doing a great job, I\\'ll tell you they\\'re looking, they\\'re going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job. Should we doing a great job, but just an okay job? It doesn\\'t matter as long as you win. You know what I gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom. I said, \"What the heck, if I win, nobody cares, if I don\\'t.\" Look if you win, nobody cares what room you\\'re in. If you lose, nobody cares what room you\\'re in. So we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, that\\'s it, no big deal. I think it this way, if we win, nobody cares. And if we lose, I\\'m out of there, I save a hell of a lot of money. Every place that we\\'ve gone, it\\'s been amazing. I\\'d also like to recognize, so important, a woman who\\'s really helped us win North Carolina in 2016, I have a feeling this year, she\\'ll even do better, because she happened to grow up here, Lara Trump and my son Eric Trump. Two great people. I mean I have to say that about my son, but I know a lot of people don\\'t like their sons that much, but Lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job. She knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here. How are we doing, Lara? How are we doing? How are we doing in the state, are we doing good? And we\\'re doing well in Pennsylvania I hear, and South Carolina, I know we\\'re doing great there. Also with us tonight, is a man who\\'s really become a good friend of mine. We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didn\\'t get along, I would not be here. I wouldn\\'t do this. I think he\\'s been tremendous. He\\'s been a tremendous supporter and things that we\\'ve wanted to do, and fights that we\\'ve had which were so important, he\\'s been right up, and Lizzie will tell you that he\\'s been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term. Probably a lot longer than that, but he\\'s going to come up and I\\'m going to ask Senator Thom Tillis, come on up. Thom has really been incredible, he\\'s been working everyday. And he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration. Thom is the champion for the people of North Carolina. This November, we need everybody to go and vote for Thom, he\\'s doing great. He\\'s doing great. I hear he\\'s way up in the polls, he\\'s way up in the polls. Thom, say a few words. \"Get me off this stage. Get me off. You guys didn\\'t tell me this was going to happen.\" No, that was great Thom. We\\'re also honored to be joined tonight by a true American hero, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old. His name is George Washington Perry, legit. George, thank you very much for being here. Thank you, George. 100 years. He\\'s 100 and he looks good. Thank you, George. With the help of everyone here tonight, America has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth. Since my election over 219,000 new jobs have been created right here in North Carolina. We have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps. Median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history, that\\'s happening, that\\'s happening. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history. Very important to me, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. For decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed African Americans. My administration is delivering for African Americans like never before. No president has done more for our black community, no president has done more for our black community, and it\\'s an honor to do it. Last month here in Charlotte, we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all Americans. It\\'s called Opportunity Now, you know about it. We\\'re also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave, reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40,000,000 american families an average of $2,200 thanks to the Republican child tax credit. The Republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did, but the Democrats are saying, \"How did they do that one?\". The USMCA is a giant for North Carolina\\'s incredible farmers and factory workers. And by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax. You know about the death tax, right? It\\'s called the inheritance tax. You have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax. So if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, there\\'s no tax to be paid by your children. So they don\\'t have to go back to the evil banker, borrow money from the banker, lose the farm, lose the business, it won\\'t happen. And I always say, I know a lot of parents that don\\'t love the children very much. Is there anybody in this room that does not love your children? Please raise your hand. Please raise your hand. Nobody. Nobody, that\\'s because we\\'re North Carolina, you love your children. But if you don\\'t, then it doesn\\'t matter because if you don\\'t love your children, don\\'t leave them a damn thing, but you don\\'t have the inheritance tax anymore, which is great. A lot of people don\\'t even know that, but that\\'s a big deal or no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betraying the American people than on the issue of immigration sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities. Right here in North Carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it. Killing her and dumping her body into the woods. Last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina, how did that happen to North Carolina? Deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of, and these are really dangerous criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of burglary, gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even suffering they inflict on our people. We\\'re building the wall. We\\'re building the wall. We\\'re building the wall. We\\'re building the wall. Mexico\\'s paying for the wall, by the way. We built 127 miles as of today, 127. Mexico is paying for the wall. The media is going to be thrilled when I explain that Mexico is paying for the wall because you know, now finally they said I\\'ve had obstruction like you wouldn\\'t believe. The entire democratic party. I could get anything. I created Space Force. I could do anything. I could get. Lindsey and Thom Tillis knows. Mark knows this. All of them knows this. If I wanted 25 cents for the wall, they didn\\'t want to get it. They didn\\'t want to do it, but now we got it, and you think that\\'s easy? Nobody else could have done this. We\\'re building it. We\\'re building our hearts away. We\\'ll soon be building many, many miles a week, but we\\'re up to over 125, I guess 127, 28 by now, of the super duper wall, super duper. I went to Border Patrol, I said, \" What is your wish?\" \"Well, sir, we\\'d like it to be steel and concrete.\" They want it exactly what they have it, and the barriers up top, they want everything. It\\'s called a no climb provisor, no climb provisor. I said, \"What does the word provisor mean?\" They didn\\'t know. All it means is you\\'re not able to climb over it. It is very tough. I don\\'t know if you saw. In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down. That\\'s what the no climb is. That\\'s what the no climb is. It\\'s a no climb. It\\'s more money. It\\'s a little more expensive. Thank you. Who is that? What a voice. Pavarotti. So, we\\'re building the wall. It\\'s going great. So, they said, \"All right. He\\'s building the wall, but Mexico\\'s not paying for it.\" Yes, they are. You\\'ll see. You\\'ll see. You understand. Some of you understand because I told a few people last week, it got linked to the fake news media. If you want to end sanctuary cities in North Carolina and across America, then you have only one choice. You must vote Republican. You have to. You have to. We\\'ve added catch and release, one of the worst loopholes you\\'ve ever seen, catch and release. You catch them. You then say, \"Where do you live?\" They don\\'t know because look, let\\'s face it, they don\\'t know. I understand that. It\\'s not even to be laughed at. They don\\'t know. \"Where do you live?\" I don\\'t know. Mexico, maybe, Honduras, Guatemala, who knows? El Salvador. \"Where do you live?\" Like this guy, he\\'s a Mexican. You\\'re about as Mexican as I am. Look at this guy. He\\'s as Mexican as I am. Look at that hat. Are you Mexican? Are you Mexican? No, you\\'re not. Are you? He is. It\\'s like Elizabeth Warren. She said she was an Indian. I said, \"I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none. She said, \"Oh, this is terrible.\" So she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her. Right? 1024th, right? One thousandths, so I was right. I probably have more in me. What a phony she is. What a phony. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 Congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders\\' healthcare takeover. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security, and they are going to destroy your social security. Remember they used to say with me, \"I\\'m going to end it the first day.\" Well, you know what, we\\'re going to soon be four years and all I\\'ve done is make it stronger. You know that. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. You\\'re going to have great health. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember President Obama? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. 28 times. They said, \"Impeach him. You should impeach him.\" 28 times he lied. 28 times on record, \"You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.\" Well, that\\'s not true. It wasn\\'t. Impeach him. We\\'re making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office. We are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they\\'re better plans. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, and we are trying terminate, in the Supreme Court of the United States, the worst healthcare in the world, and we are going to give you the best healthcare you\\'ve ever seen at a low price and again, protecting preexisting conditions. Protecting preexisting conditions. We\\'re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. You know what that is? Surprise. You get all sorts of surprises. We have people that take a blood test in one place, it\\'s $26, and in another place it\\'s $2000. Same blood test, maybe the cheap one is better, who knows? Same blood test. It\\'s wrong. Surprise medical building. Bombed. Out. Billing. I signed an executive order opposing price transparency that\\'s going to be bigger than healthcare, because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. Right? It\\'s a big thing. It\\'s a big thing. We\\'ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. We have given them, and there\\'s a lot of political pressure not to do that, you can understand why. To care for our amazing veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, and nobody said it could be done. So now, instead of waiting in line for days and days, and weeks and weeks to see a doctor, you go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get all fixed up. What a great thing. It\\'s called VA Choice. I got it done. They\\'ve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they haven\\'t been able to. Those people over there were a great help. We have passed the spectacular Right to Try. You know what that is? Hopefully nobody in the room needs. Hopefully nobody in the room needs Right to Try. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We\\'ve launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer\\'s, and we\\'re pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America\\'s youngest patients, and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb, right up until the very moment of birth. How about that? That is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God. Then you have the Governor of Virginia. The baby is born. The baby is born and he says, \"And then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby.\" This is the Governor of Virginia. The Governor of Virginia. He\\'s a beauty. You remember what he did? He wanted to dance like Michael Jackson and his wife stopped him. He got lucky. But the Governor of Virginia wanted to do that. The baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother. The doctor will now talk, and you\\'ll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives. Did you ever hear of anything like this? The Democratic party is the party of high taxes, high crime, unlimited regulations, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. So many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight, and we\\'re doing it for school choice, so that every child who needs it, gets it. No parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Alice Johnson, do we love Alice Johnson? This could not have been done by anyone other than the Republican party. I recognized Israel\\'s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our historic investments in the United States military include $200 million to a place that nobody\\'s heard of in this audience, I\\'m sure, Fort Bragg. $300 million for Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. More than $500 million for Marine Corps Air Station New River. Listen to this one. No Democrat\\'s going to this. They don\\'t even want to spend money on the military. They don\\'t like the military. They\\'re not going to spend money. $1.2 billion for Camp Lejeune. $1.2 billion. Do you think that a guy like sleepy Joe\\'s going to put, he doesn\\'t know what it means. I know what I means. We have to have a strong military. We have the strongest military we\\'ve ever had. When I came in, our military was in sad shape. It was depleted, but we\\'ve rebuilt it, $2.5 trillion dollars went into our military. 01] is the actual survival of an our nation itself. If you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of Americans who fought and died to secure, and you know what they\\'re securing, they are securing us, they\\'re securing our freedom, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November, November 3rd to be exact. Only this way can we save the America we love, and drain the Washington swamp, which is by the way, much more vicious, much dirtier, much deeper than I ever thought, but we are kicking ass. With your help, we will lift billions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration, and we will continue with the great Thom Tillis. We will get Thom Tillis. Thom, I don\\'t think anybody even wants to run against you, Thom, but we\\'re going to reelect Thom Tillis. Is that right? We\\'re going to reelect Thom Tillis. If we don\\'t, I\\'m going to be so angry at you. I\\'ll only come back here a few times a year. No, Thom is going to be great. Thom, I think you\\'re in great shape. I think you\\'re in great shape. One more hand for Thom Tillis, please. We don\\'t even know who\\'s running against him. Nobody wants the run. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right? Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in less than nine years. We\\'ve already started. Who would have thought? We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. Your second amendment rights are under siege. Believe me, they\\'re under siege. We don\\'t get in, you can forget your second amendment. That\\'s what I think. I really believe it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that binds us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust. From Fayetteville to Wilmington, from Raleigh to Greensboro, from Asheville to Kitty Hawk, to right here in Charlotte, this state is the home to some of the toughest men and strongest women, and most incredible patriots ever to walk the face of the Earth. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, blazed the trail, sailed the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two world wars, defeated fascism, and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, that\\'s what\\'s happening. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Because together, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we have made America great again. Thank you. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you.\\nThank you very much. Thank you, Minnesota. This is a great state. We are going to win this state in a very short period of time. Thank you. This feels like the day before the election. So we have 20,000-plus people inside. We just set a new record. And we have 25,000 people that we still love, outside. And close to 100,000 people wanted to come tonight. Thank you all. This is great. This is really great. Thank you. I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, and Karen Pence, for being here tonight. It is great to be back in the Twin Cities with the freedom-loving American patriots who make our country run. You know that. You know it. For the next 13 months, think of that, it seems like yesterday, for the next 13 months, we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul, and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020. America now has the number one economy anywhere in the world, and it\\'s not even close. You know I\\'m dealing with China right now. They\\'re in Washington. We\\'re going to see if we make a deal. But they want to make it. We\\'re going to determine whether or not we want to make it. But they\\'ve been very nice. And today I got a call from one of the top representatives, he said, \"Congratulations, Mr. President, on having a truly great, great economy.\" That\\'s pretty nice. We picked up, since the election, trillions of dollars in value. And China has lost trillions of dollars in value. I will say this, if our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now China would become the … It would be the number one economy anywhere in the world. And right now I can tell you they\\'re not even close. Our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting, for the first time in a long time, we are putting America first.  cops love Trump, Trump loves cops. Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know what\\'s happened, it\\'s enraged the failed ruling class in Washington. Not easy to get them out, but we\\'re doing it slowly, but surely. These corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding America dry. And they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country. And that\\'s what they were doing. And that\\'s what they continue to try and do. That is why, from day one, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election, the election of 2016. They\\'re trying. They\\'re not getting very far. They want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice. And they want to erase your future. But they will fail, because in America, the people rule again. Do you remember that, just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, The Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesn\\'t know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case, they might\\'ve gotten it pretty correct, they said, \"The Campaign To Impeach President Trump Has Begun.\" That was the headline. Little did we know they weren\\'t playing games. Think of that. That was 19 minutes after the oath of office. Months earlier, Peter Strzok, remember, he and his lover, Lisa Page. What a group. \"She\\'s going to win 10 million to one. She\\'s going to win. I\\'m telling you, Peter. I\\'m telling you, Peter, she\\'s going to win. Peter. Oh, I love you so much.\" \"I love you, Peter.\" \"I love you too, Lisa. Lisa, I love you. Lisa, Lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa. And if she doesn\\'t win, Lisa, we\\'ve got an insurance policy, Lisa. We\\'ll get that son of a bitch out. We got an insurance policy.\" And we\\'re living through the insurance policy. That\\'s what it is. The phony Russia hoax. \" Lisa, I love you.\" Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate. 13 months, they got to move fast, because they\\'re not beating us at the polls and they know it, despite the phony polls that you see all the time, their phony polls. You know, polls are no different. Remember I always used to talk about polls, I know polls very well. Polls are no different than crooked writers. They\\'re crooked polls. They\\'re crooked polls. No different. Boy, that\\'s a lot of media. Look back there. That\\'s a lot of media. They are so dishonest. And frankly, they are so bad for our country. They are so bad. And they could be so good for our country. They could be so good. And maybe they\\'ll change, and maybe they won\\'t. I\\'ve been waiting for a long time. After I won the last election, I said, \"Finally it\\'s okay. Finally I\\'ll get some great press.\" They got worse. They got worse. I said, \"Finally, we\\'re going to get …\" I said to the first lady, \"Darling, we\\'re going to finally get respect. We\\'re going to finally get media and press coverage. It\\'s going to be great. Look at what we\\'ve done.\" And I\\'m telling you, they did, they got worse. They know they cannot win. You understand. Well, if you didn\\'t understand, honestly, there\\'s no way anybody could win, because you\\'d believe them. If you believe them, there\\'s no way anybody could … Because it\\'s like 94% … I can do the greatest things in history, and they\\'ll make them bad to very bad. And if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, it\\'s like, \"Give him the electric chair. That was terrible.\" Right? No, this is the worst. These people and the Democrats, they\\'re partners. It\\'s a partnership. How about on the newscast, like the word \"manufactured,\" it\\'s manu… And every newscast, \"Tonight, in a manufactured deal along the border …\" The word\\'s never been used … All of a sudden every newscast is using it. It\\'s a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats. So they know they can\\'t win the 2020 election, so they\\'re pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt. I\\'ve been going through it now for more time than I\\'ve been in office. Because, like Strzok with his insurance deal, this was before, remember this, this was before, that statement was made months before I took office. That statement was made months before the election took place. They said, \"Just in case, we\\'re going to have an insurance policy.\" That only means one thing, \"We\\'re going to get him out.\" So they\\'re telling us. We can\\'t let that ever happen again to another president. And Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, a lot of people, the great Mark Levin. We have a lot of great people. Lou Dobbs, great people. You know what they said? Every one of them, plus many others, \"There\\'s no other man that we\\'ve ever met that could have taken it.\" It\\'s true. Maybe I\\'m a little different up here. I don\\'t know. But I enjoy it. To me, I\\'m energized because we\\'re draining the swamp. The Democrats\\' brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country. These are bad people. My phone call, as an example, with the president of Ukraine, was perfect. Everybody that looked at it. And the only reason I released it was that the Democrats put out a phony narrative. So I had no choice. And I don\\'t want to do that as president, every time a president from a country calls me, or I call them, we have to release the text. How can you do business that way? Who\\'s going to want to speak to your president? So the president of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference, on other subjects, that he was under absolutely no pressure. He doesn\\'t even know what they\\'re talking about. And he used the word, there was no \"blackmail\" during this call. He used that term. So in theory, that should be the end of it. Think of it, a president of the United States who\\'s made our economy, with a lot of help from all of you, frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us, we made this the strongest economy in our history. We\\'ve rebuilt our military. We\\'re taking care of healthcare like nobody\\'s been able to do. What we\\'ve done is incredible. And by the way, we\\'re protecting your Second Amendment. If you don\\'t have me, your Second Amendment is gone. So we have the greatest economy, the greatest military. We\\'ve rebuilt our military, $2. 5 trillion, because when I took it over, it was a mess. And what do they want to do? \"Let\\'s impeach our president,\" right? I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think so. I think we\\'re going to have a turnout the likes of which we\\'ve never seen in the history of our country. So we were really forced, just to put it away, we were forced. I said, \"Just do it.\" Got the approval from Ukraine. I have to ask. I said, \"Hey, do you guys mind?\" They said, \"That\\'s a strange request.\" I said, \"Don\\'t worry about it. Do you mind?\" And they said, \"Please, go ahead. Nothing was said wrong on that call.\" So we released the transcript of the call, which was so good that that crooked Adam Schiff, this guy is crooked, he had to make up a fake conversation that never happened- A fake conversation that never happened, and he delivered it to the United States Congress and the American people. It was a total fraud. And then Nancy Pelosi said, \"Oh, I think the president said that.\" These people are sick. I\\'m telling you, they\\'re sick. And you know what? Had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word. It would\\'ve been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early, they said all these horrible things. You know why? Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call. So Nancy Pelosi, upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call, or somebody gave her very bad advice, but also hearing it from shifty shift Nancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian president, \"We\\'ve got to impeach him. We\\'ve got to impeach him.\" Right? And then she saw the call and she said to her people, \"What the hell? Nobody ever told me this was the call.\" But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands. The do nothing democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally, and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual, beautiful, accurate phone call with a foreign leader. I don\\'t think so. As our brilliant White House counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said, \"Their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people.\" That\\'s what it is. To the American people. It\\'s so terrible. Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy. That\\'s what\\'s happening. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them. I mean, look at their debates. These people are crazy. They want to spend $99 trillion to redo buildings all over the United States. I said, \"What about China? What about Russia? What about India? What about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out?\" It\\'s all right. Let him give you the answer. Man, did the cops act fast. He\\'s already gone. That\\'s unbelievable. That\\'s the fastest … You know I have … Look, I love law enforcement. I love the cops. I love the police, all of it. Minneapolis, Minneapolis, you\\'ve got a rotten man. You\\'ve got to change your mayor. You\\'ve got a bad mayor. You\\'ve got a bad mayor. But you know what? The police … I\\'ve done this a lot and every once in a while we\\'ll have very little disturbance. It\\'s really … Actually, is there any place where we can have more fun than at a Trump rally? And we\\'ve set every record at every place, virtually, that we\\'ve gone. And one of the big musicians said, \"And Trump does it without a guitar.\" Can you believe it? Without a guitar. But this guy … So I\\'ve had it a lot where … But sometimes it\\'ll take the police like 30 seconds, 50 seconds. It\\'s like Roger Penske when you watch him, who\\'s getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by the way, pretty soon. He won 18 Indy 500s, 18, Roger Penske. But it\\'s like the way they change those tires, takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing. I say, \"How the hell do they do it?\" That\\'s the way these cops just reacted. That was a record. I think it was a … I\\'ve had good service, but I\\'ve never had anything like that. I look up, the guy is already gone. Ah, we love you with the red shirts. So now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe Biden. And you know what? I\\'d love to run against him, to be honest. Anybody like that. If you can\\'t beat him in a debate, you\\'ve got a big problem folks. You can\\'t beat him in a debate, you can\\'t be president. Because what are you going to do against President Xi and Kim Jong Un. You can\\'t beat sleepy Joe, but now we\\'re going to meet with Kim Jong Un? I don\\'t think so. But he\\'s totally owned and totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years. Two months after president Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy. Listen to this. And the press will not write it. They say, \"In totally unsubstantiated charges …\" every time they talk about him. President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune. Now you know that\\'s a totally unsubstantiated charge. Really? It\\'s not an unsubstantiated, it\\'s fact. Joe\\'s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days. By the way, whatever happened to Hunter. Where the hell is he? Where\\'s Hunter? Hey fellows, I have an idea for a new t-shirt. I love the cops, but let\\'s do another t-shirt. Where\\'s Hunter? Where is he? Here\\'s Hunter, being examined by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd or some of these people. Hunter, it\\'s so great that you\\'re here, sir. Hunter, I know they\\'re giving you approximately $168,000 a month. I hear they paid you a big check of $3 million. I just want to speak on behalf of NBC who\\'s absolutely one of the worst. I just want to tell you … Hunter, Hunter I just want to tell you I couldn\\'t be happier for you and your family and I know you don\\'t know anything about energy and I know it\\'s an energy company, but I think they made a great deal, Hunter. And then they fly to China, and I\\'m dealing with people right now. They\\'re tough as hell, those Chinese negotiators, and Hunter, who\\'s not too smart, Hunter. He goes in, he has a meeting, he walks out in his fund with 1.5 billion, with a B, one point five billion dollars. These aren\\'t the same Chinese negotiators that I\\'m dealing with, I can tell you. These are not the same ones, but we are doing very well in that negotiation. Now, think of it, where\\'s Hunter? Where is Hunter? I want to see Hunter? Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. Hunter, you\\'re a loser. Why did you get one point five billion dollars, Hunter. And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good Senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\\'s ass. True. Thank you. Thank you. It\\'s true. It\\'s true. And they\\'re always saying the same thing. Yeah, he got a billion five, we admit it, they admit it, it\\'s nothing, but oh, it\\'s not that same thing, president Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about Hunter Biden and his father. It\\'s not unsubstantiated, you crooked son of a guns, it\\'s 100% true. 100%. Even the smart guys on Wall Street, and I know all of them, they are smart. They\\'ve never seen anything like that one before. I\\'ve called them. Does that ever happen? Never happens. Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing. Walks out with a billion five. Gee. Flies in on Air Force Two with his father, the vice president. Don\\'t forget, that\\'s when he was vice president. So China gives his son 1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don\\'t think so. I don\\'t think so. Meanwhile, Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president, and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we\\'re not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich and that is substantiated. While America got robbed, that\\'s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends out America, they didn\\'t have tough negotiations. I look at these trade deals and I say, \"Who the hell could have done this?\" If you didn\\'t … If you had no business instinct, no business ability, if you had nothing, if you\\'re dumb as hell, you wouldn\\'t make these deals, they\\'re so bad. I say, \"Who made these deals? Who made these deals?\" But we\\'re ripping them all up and redoing them and they\\'re going to be very good. Wait until you see what happens. Now that I\\'m your president, you see it. America is winning again and we\\'re respected again as a nation. A brand new report just came out as I\\'m walking on the stage. Hard to believe, actually. It turns out that Joe Biden was vice president, he worked with the so called whistle blower. This is nothing but a partisan witch hunt, sabotage, and I\\'m sure they\\'re going to say it\\'s totally unsubstantiated, but one of them wrote this story. Congratulations, by the way. That\\'s very nice. That\\'s really good. That\\'s the way you should do it. Good. Good. Good. In the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media, it\\'s okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries, flood our communities with drugs and crime, and enrich themselves at America\\'s expense. Their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game, and it is far more rigged. When I ran, I thought it was rigged, but this is crazy what\\'s happening. But if you refuse to bow or bend to the Washington swamp, which I could do very easily, I\\'d be much more popular. Folks, it would be so much easier. But they smear you, they spy on you, and they target your friends, your family, your staff for harassment, for abuse, for destruction. I came down to Washington with incredible people. We won a great political campaign. They were bright eyed and bushy tailed. that\\'s a nice phrase. They came down, they were happy. They wanted to turn the country around. They wanted to do great things. All of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller. How good was he as a witness? Not too good and by people that were, I call them the 13 angry Democrats, that turned into 18 angry Democrats. It was disgraceful. So people that were going down, \"Sir, what is this?\" I look, \"Oh wow, that\\'s a subpoena.\" What the hell is this? They took people … I really mean this. They took people that were full of life and energy and vigor. We had just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics, it\\'s true. It\\'s true. And they destroyed their lives. They destroyed their lives. They went home. I could name many people, one in particular, who came down, an incredible young woman. She was going to help people. She wanted to help people. She had causes that were so good. She wanted to help people, and she ended up going home, dark, dark. Her life became hell. They ruined people. They destroyed people, good people. People that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made. Than they made. They destroyed great people. They\\'re vicious, horrible, and the media was behind every single step. They destroyed so many lives. They destroyed so many lives, and they\\'re continuing to do it. And it\\'s a disgrace. When all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds, these sinister fakers then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption. There\\'s nothing like the dirty political establishment, and I have to tell you, this is, friend of mine, very smart, brilliant guy, was with me about two weeks ago. We just got rid of the Russia hoax and then a week later the Ukraine hoax starts. I had a week of like, \"I can think about everything perfect. It\\'s so beautiful.\" And he said, \"President.\" I said, \"Call me Donald. You\\'ve called me Donald for 35 years.\" \"I will. Thank you Donald.\" I\\'ve lost all my friends because they\\'re all scared to talk. Honestly, I\\'m the president that they can\\'t talk to me anymore. It\\'s like they\\'re afraid. They respect the office. It\\'s true. They say, \"President.\" I say, \"Do me a favor, Richard. You\\'ve called me Donald for 35 years. Call me Donald, please. I want somebody to call me Donald.\" True. He said to me, I just told him call me … He said, \"President, I can\\'t do it.\" He said. So he says, \"President, you\\'ve been here now for, think of it, almost three years. Can you believe we\\'re here three years?\" We, we, it\\'s we. And we have to promise them no more than 16 years. Okay? No more. No more. 16 more years. I\\'m only kidding. Now they\\'ll go back. See, he wants to run for more. But he said, \"President, could I ask you a question? It\\'s so important to me.\" He\\'s a great businessman, very successful. He said, \"You deal with all of these nations, these great, powerful … Who is the worst to deal with? Is it China? Is it North Korea? Is India? Is it Russia? Please tell me, Mr. Pres, who is the toughest nation to deal with?\" I said, \"You\\'re not going to believe this. It\\'s the USA is the toughest nation to deal with.\" The USA. It\\'s true. Because we\\'re dealing with some very sick and deranged people. There is nothing that the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate, own and control. They\\'re trying to stop me because they know that I don\\'t answer to them, I answer to you. It\\'s true. I never say this. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever said it in a speech, but they\\'ll find out if I did. They\\'ll give me Pinocchios, he said it before, but I don\\'t know if I ever said this before. But I make, as president, about $450,000. I give it away. I don\\'t care. I don\\'t want it. I never hear anything. Can you imagine if I didn\\'t. I give it away to … You can only give it, you can\\'t keep it. You can\\'t actually make a gift. You can give it to your different agencies. So I can give it to health, I can give it to transportation, I can give it to military, but I give it away all the time. Now, and if I ever did … But it\\'s 450. If somebody stays from, let\\'s say, a middle East country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying, and I never heard of the guy and I don\\'t want to hear about him, they say, \"Trump is getting rich off our nation.\" I lose billions being president. I don\\'t care. It\\'s nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions. If somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees, I never heard of the people. I never know who they are. They say, \"Emoluments.\" Nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before. Emoluments. It\\'s the craziest thing I\\'ve ever seen. I tell you, it\\'s cost me billions of dollars to be president. It really has. And at some point I\\'ll probably to prove that, and I look forward to doing it.. It\\'s very easy. It\\'s very easy. And there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created. So in desperate attempt to attack our movement. Nancy and Chuck, two beauties, have given control of the Democrat party entirely over to the radical left, including Minnesota\\'s own representative Ilhan Omar. I know you people. I know you people. I know the people of Minnesota, and I want to tell you, and I also, at the same time, it\\'s both a question and a statement, how\\'d the hell did that ever happen? How did it happen? How did it happen? Congresswoman Omar is an America hating socialist. She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland. Where far more than 3,000 people died, saying, \"Some people did something big deal. Some people did something.\" She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota. Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda. You remember that tape? Speak of Al-Qaeda. But when we say something about the United States, you just don\\'t say America with any intensity. Remember that? Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not. She\\'s said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country. Omar wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States. How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I\\'m very angry at you people right now. She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I\\'m going to win, and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months. Thank you very much. So we\\'re honored to have with us today a special guest, a man that really is a terrific talented writer. He knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of Omar. Mr. Scott Johnson of Power Line. He wrote some stuff, I can\\'t believe it. Where\\'s Scott? Where\\'s Scott? Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Scott. What a job. Man, do you have her figured out. The only problem is, Scott, it\\'s incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about. The problem is they never pick it up. They don\\'t want to pick it up, but we pick it up, Scott, and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting. Thank you. Thank you very much. And Scott reported everything about Omar is a fraud, including her name. Scott reports his sources told him that, quote, Omar\\'s legal husband was Omar\\'s brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes. You mean like coming into the United States, maybe? And as Scott says, \"We have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like Omar\\'s in Congress, and nothing gets done about it.\" I hope that some of you people are looking, because what AOC has gotten away with campaign financing and what … I call it AOC plus three, that\\'s what it is. And Omar is one of the three. What AOC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse, and nothing happens to them, but it happens to you, and it\\'s not fair. The fact is, we\\'re in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America. The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand- Message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020. With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate and we will win the White House. And we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much. One of your tremendous talented, tough, Congressman Tom Emmer. Tom. Also a man, you don\\'t want to fight him, and you don\\'t want to play him in hockey because he was tough. He just won, not that recently but pretty recently, and I was out here campaigning for him and working hard, and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him. Congressman Pete Stauber. And a man who gets in the trenches, and he just doesn\\'t care. He wants to win for the people. He loves you. He loves this state. He loves this country. Jim Hagedorn. Thank you. And a great friend of mine with his incredible family. He\\'s a friend. He\\'s smart. I guess you\\'d say he\\'s brilliant. His education is incredible, his military career has been incredible. Then he ran for office, and now he\\'s a United States Senator from the great state of Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton. Great guy. And Minnesota Senate Majority Leader, Paul Gazelka. Paul. Thank you Paul. Minnesota GOP Chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan. She\\'s been incredible. I said, \"Jennifer, are we going to win in 13 months?\" She said, \"Honestly sir, I\\'ve never seen anything like this. It\\'s going to be easy. Don\\'t ever say… Just assume we\\'re two points behind, okay?\" Two points behind. You never ever… Please. Always just assume you\\'re a little behind, but we\\'re going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked. Ad plenty of other states too. We had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico, and New Mexico\\'s a hard state for Republicans, hasn\\'t been won in a long time also. And we had receptivity that was unbelievable. The audience was 40% Hispanic, where we\\'re doing great. And you know, Hispanic, they understand borders better than anybody, better than we do. They understand safety, they understand their job, they don\\'t want people taking it away, they don\\'t want crime. They understand it better. That\\'s why we\\'re doing so well, but we\\'re in New Mexico, and I\\'m telling you, that was electric. But honestly, all evenings are electric. We haven\\'t had any bad ones. We haven\\'t. They\\'re all electric. A woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me, a state that hadn\\'t been won in a long time by a Republican for whatever reason, but it hadn\\'t been won. I guess we didn\\'t have the right candidates, right? But a woman who would call me constantly. I\\'d say, \"I don\\'t want to talk to her. She\\'s giving me a headache.\" \"Sir, if you make one more trip, you\\'re going to win Michigan.\" I say, \"All right,\" I make the trip, I go back home. I get a call the next morning, \"Sir, we need one more.\" This went over and over and over, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan, and I said, \"Who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan and speak just one more time every week? One more time, sir.\" And her name is Ronna McDaniel. She\\'s fantastic, and she\\'s the head of the RNC. She\\'s great. And our campaign manager, a man who\\'s really been… They used to say that Crooked Hillary had a very very sophisticated campaign. After she lost, they said, \"I guess it wasn\\'t sophisticated.\" We had a sophisticated campaign. Nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy. Brad Parscale. Remember when they used to say it? You know, I never got credit. My father used to teach me, if you can do it for less and win, that\\'s good. He wasn\\'t talking politics. The last thing… He\\'s looking down. He\\'s definitely looking down, not looking up. He was great. He was tough, but he was great. But my father would say, \"If you could do it for less and win, that\\'s a good thing, not a bad thing. If you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street, and if it\\'s a nicer building and you can rent for less, you\\'re really… That\\'s like a good thing.\" So in the campaign, we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary Clinton, much. And we won. And we won. We won 306 to 223. That\\'s a pretty big… Remember? Remember they said electoral college. By the way, when you run, if you\\'re running, the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash, and the total vote, you don\\'t go certain places. You focus. Electoral college. We have to explain to them, it\\'s different. So we won 306, and do you remember they sued to say one\\'s the 100 yard dash. You practice. One\\'s the mile. You practice. It\\'s a different race. Winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion. The electoral college, I had to go to 22 different states. For the total vote, I\\'d go to four states maximum, right? Much easier. It\\'s much easier. I\\'m all for it, but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn\\'t go. I love Maine. I went to Maine four or five times. I needed one point. Maine gave me one point. And what happened? What happened? I went there numerous times. Everyone said, \"Why?\" Because I was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that Trump cannot get to 270. He cannot get… They had me maximum, if everything worked, right? At 269. So I kept going to Maine, and you know what? We won that one point in Maine. We won it. It\\'s true. But I kept going. They say, \"Why?\" I said, \"Well, first of all, it is really a beautiful place,\" but we won the point. But they said, \"He can not get to 270,\" and I heard this for months and months. I had such a headache, almost as bad as listening to Mike\\'s damn commercials about those pillows. Maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache. Does it cure headaches? I think so. But here\\'s the thing. Here\\'s the thing. So they said, \"He cannot get to 270.\" In other words, you can\\'t win. You don\\'t get to 270, it\\'s over. You can\\'t win, right? He cannot do it. There\\'s no way of doing it, and they were right. I got to 306. They were right. But I didn\\'t get to 306. You got to 306. We won incredible states. We won incredible states. We won Wisconsin, we won Michigan, we won Pennsylvania, we won North Carolina, we won South Carolina, we won Florida. What a run. Do you remember the evening that we won? I think… Look, forgetting me, I think it was won of all of us together because we all worked hard. I was the messenger, but we all worked hard. That was our victory, not my victory. But that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television, one of the greatest nights, and hopefully it\\'ll go down when we\\'re allowed to get all of this stuff seeded… You know, it\\'s like a tree. You plant it. You plant it. It has to go, but it needs a little… That\\'s why we need the four more additionally years. It\\'s got to grab on and catch, so they can\\'t destroy it. So they can\\'t destroy it. But I think it\\'ll go down, and I hope it\\'s going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country, because it\\'s never happened, anything like that before. And these guys don\\'t even question it. They just sit back and say, \"I guess he\\'s right about that.\" I\\'ll never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena. The place was going crazy. It was like this, going crazy, and two reporters that hate my guts, they looked at themselves, they looked at each other. Famous shot. They\\'re looking like this and they\\'re saying, \"What the hell is going on?\" They knew. They knew. And I didn\\'t need Beyonce and Jay Z, and I didn\\'t need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people. They\\'d get all these people. They\\'d come in because she couldn\\'t get a crowd. They\\'d come in, they\\'d sing. They got Bruce Springsteen. Okay? He\\'d do about two songs and leave. What happens is, they leave, and then everyone leaves with them, and she\\'s still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd. It\\'s the craziest thing I\\'ve ever seen. And then they complain. Sometimes I\\'ll use terrible word like hell. The other day I used the word hell. I got hell from… They said, \"He used terrible language.\" I used the word hell. It was so bad. But you\\'ve got to hear Jay Z, the words he was using, he was using the F word all over the place, and then the next day they say I use bad language. The word hell is a terrible word. These people are sick. But that was an amazing evening. I\\'ll never forget that evening. Look. Outside of your family and your children and things… I love you too, darling. It was one of the highest rated evenings in the history of television. You add up all those networks. Remember the woman crying? Oh my God. No, they weren\\'t biased at all. Now, another very special man who\\'s with us today, but he\\'ll never be a man to me, he\\'ll always be my boy, you know what I mean? Right? He\\'s my boy. He\\'s my little six foot six boy, Eric Trump. And the parents understand that, right? They may be big and strong and older. To a parent, a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl, and I know that\\'s probably politically incorrect. They\\'ll say, \"It was terrible what he said about women. Terrible.\" But they\\'re our boy and they\\'re our girl, and it doesn\\'t matter how old we get and how old they get, is that a correct statement? And I\\'m also proud to endorse your next Republican Senator from Minnesota, a man that I\\'ve known, a man that is tough and smart, a man that\\'s running against somebody that\\'s never done a damn thing in the Senate, Mr. Jason Lewis. And Jason did a great job in Congress. Congressman Lewis, thank you very much, and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because I\\'ll tell you, it\\'s going to be nasty. It\\'s going to be nasty. They\\'re going to make up stories about you. They\\'re going to say things that\\'s going to want to make your wife say, \"Why did I marry this guy?\" Just say, \"Don\\'t worry about it. It\\'s just another phony story.\" Thank you very much Mr. and Mrs. Lewis. Jason, thank you. And Jason, they can say that about Tom Cotton. He\\'s too perfect, this guy. He can\\'t say… They can\\'t say it about you, Tom. Anyway, good luck Jason. Do well. And I don\\'t know why, but with all of the great people I just introduced, for tonight, maybe this is the most important person, because I turned on a very good show in the morning. Fox and friends. They treat us great. I just want fairness. What a great group. Ainsley and Steve, and by the way, Brian has gotten a lot better, right? And how good does Jessie Waters do? How good? Right? Just some really great people. And again, Tucker\\'s been very good I have to say. He\\'s been good. Smart. He\\'s been great. Tucker, and the legendary Sean Hannity. Great. Number one. Number one show. Sean\\'s got the number one show. And Laura Ingraham is knocking them out of the park, Laura. And you go over, Maria Bartiromo, and the great Lou Dobbs. How good are they? Lou Dobbs. And many more. And many more. How about Greg? Greg used to hate me. Now, he\\'s good. Oh, we can\\'t forget… We can\\'t forget Judge Jeanine. I would be in such trouble if I forgot Judge Jeanine. No, these are… And there are many more. I just… Look, I\\'m just rattling some names off, but they\\'re just terrific people. They\\'re terrific people. But a man that I have to really say something very special about… 00 slot, because I\\'m out of there pretty good, and I see a handsome young man named Bob Kroll, Cops For Trump. And he\\'s talking about this lousy mayor they\\'ve got. Now, he didn\\'t quite say that, but I say it. He\\'s talking about this lousy mayor that won\\'t let the cops, the police, the law enforcement… My father always used to say, \"Son…\" And he meant it to. \"Never say cops. It\\'s disrespectful. Say police officer.\" I said, \"Okay Pop.\" But honestly, the truth is with time, I love you guys whether you\\'re cops, police officers, law enforcement. I\\'ll call you whatever you want. It doesn\\'t matter. You are so great, so respected. You don\\'t even know how much our public loves you. You don\\'t know it. You don\\'t know it. You don\\'t know it. But I see this guy, and I don\\'t know if he\\'s done a lot of television before, but he was very effective and very good. And he was saying how the police aren\\'t being allowed to take care of this rally, and yet with President Obama and Bush and all these people, they were fine, fine. Everybody comes. They fall asleep at a rally. But they weren\\'t allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild. So what I want to do… Go home to Mommy. Mommy says, \"I saw you on television tonight. I love Trump. Don\\'t you ever do that again.\" \"Yes Mom. Yes Mom.\" But the job he did before the election, I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledged to address this really important issue, and it\\'s the issue of law enforcement. And when I saw this man, this great gentleman on television pouring out his guts, pouring out his heart… I don\\'t know him. He knows I\\'ve been good to law enforcement. He knows I\\'ve been good to, as my father would say, \"The police.\" He knows I love the cops. He knows that, and so does everyone else. I mean, it\\'s so many shirts, so many red shirts, and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts, and I want to just tell you, the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound. It\\'s unbound. Come up here. Bob, come up. Say something. Thank you fellas. I\\'ll see you later. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great people. Thank you. What a group. I think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on. As you know, for many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers. I promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy, and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls. And I\\'ve done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise. I issued an executive action, making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to your mayor. You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that\\'s what you have the right to do right now. And believe me, no other president would be doing that. If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before. Do you think you have it bad now? You would never have seen anything like what they want to do. But in the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota. We\\'ve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place. We are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. The president of Mexico has been incredible. We have now, 27,000 Mexican soldiers. They\\'re great, and they\\'re tough, and they are now protecting our border, and those numbers have gone down like this. Thank you Mr. President. We will not make the mistakes made in European countries, that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country, on our shores. We\\'re not going to allow it to happen. And as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us, I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get, travel ban on some of the world\\'s most dangerous countries. And the other day, one of the fake news reporters in the back said… They were talking about the travel ban, and they said, \"Well you know, the president has lost in court.\" They said, \"Where?\" \"On the travel ban.\" And he\\'s right. I lost, and then I lost at the appellate division, and then I won at the United States Supreme Court. Right? And he knew that, but he said I lost on the… And he was right. I lost, and then I lost again, but then I won, and we have the travel ban. But instead of saying, \"He lost, and then he lost at the appellate, and then he won at the United States Supreme Court,\" he said, \"He lost on the travel ban.\" These are very dishonest people. Do you understand that? Very dishonest people. In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities, and we\\'re not letting it happen anymore. Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal aliens. My administration is taking historic action to secure the border. We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and we are building the wall faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built. And this is a serious wall. You\\'ve all seen it. It\\'s going up rapidly, and you think that was easy? I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me. I had a lot of the rhinos fighting me. They say, \"See, he\\'s not getting it built. He\\'s not getting…\" Let me tell you. You have every Democrat fighting you. We took it from here, and we took it from there, and we took it from all over the place, and we got that thing. That\\'s the biggest patchwork of financing you\\'ve ever seen, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, it\\'s largely 30 feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted. I went to the Border Patrol, and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said, \"What do you want? What\\'s your ideal?\" I actually said, \"I want to give you the Rolls Royce,\" and they killed me for that. They said, \"It\\'s not an American made product.\" Yeah, they happened to be right. No, they\\'re right about that one. They\\'re actually right there, Tom. But I said, \"I want to give you the Rolls Royce of walls. Tell me.\" And they told me everything, and then we built some alternative walls. We built all different types. We built about seven of them, and then we had climbers come in. The one that worked the best was the one we\\'re building. It also, unfortunately… The bad news, it\\'s also the most expensive. But we got it for the right price. We got it for the right price. It\\'s steel, it\\'s hardened concrete, it\\'s deep, it\\'s high, it\\'s a thing of beauty. And it\\'s going to keep bad people out of our country. That\\'s what it\\'s going to do. And the Democrats knew this. Most of the Democrats four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now all of a sudden, they don\\'t want a wall. You know why they don\\'t want a wall? Because I want it. That\\'s the only reason. And I just thought of it a year ago. I said, \"Man, this could\\'ve been so much easier.\" All I had to do is say, \"We don\\'t want a wall,\" and they would\\'ve given me all the financing I wanted for the wall. What was I thinking? We\\'re not going to build a wall, and they would have forced me to build it. I would\\'ve… It\\'s true. Under this administration, we are also ending the- … this administration. We are also ending the endless wars. We have to do it, folks. We have to do it. We have totally defeated the ISIS caliphate, and I did that in rather quick time if you remember, because we have the greatest fighting machine, now. When I came in and was totally depleted. We have great generals, we have great warfighters, and they did it so fast. I flew to Iraq, I met with the generals, right? I met with the generals. I said, \"I hear it\\'s going to take a year to two years.\" \"Sir, we can do it in two weeks.\" I said, \"What?\" \"They don\\'t let us fight, sir. They don\\'t let us fight. We want to fight. They don\\'t let us fight.\" I said, \"I let you fight.\" I said, \"How come if they say it\\'s going to take anywhere from a year to two years, you say you can do it so quickly?\" He said, \"Sir, we\\'re going to hit them from the front. We\\'re going to hit them from the back. We\\'re going to hit them from the sides, from underground, from overground. We going to hit the hell out of them.\" And they did. And we won very quickly. But from now on, we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the United States of America, not to the benefit of other countries. And we will only fight to win. We\\'re only going to fight to win. We don\\'t fight to win. We don\\'t fight to win. The Turks have been fighting with the Kurds for two centuries, and Turkey, as you know, is a NATO ally. But I\\'ve been rough on them. We\\'ve defeated 100% of that ISIS caliphate, and no longer have any troops in the area. We don\\'t have any troops. The troops have been pulled out. Where Turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the Kurds, get them out. So Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds. We got along with the Kurds, and we helped the Kurds. And don\\'t forget they\\'re also fighting for their land. You know that. But they\\'re fighting. So we have three choices. You\\'re ready? Here are the three choices. We don\\'t have any soldiers there because we\\'ve left. We won. We left. Take a victory, United States. We left. Take a victory, take a victory. Bring our troops back home. I told this story yesterday, I have to sign letters, it\\'s the hardest thing I have to do. I sign letters, \"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Arkansas. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Alabama. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Somebody from some great state, I\\'m sorry to inform you, your son has been killed in combat. I\\'m so sorry.\" And every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents, they\\'re grieving, and they get together with other parents, and I don\\'t want to see that it\\'s like the same letter. So we do different letters. It\\'s the hardest thing I have to do. Hardest thing.it\\'s the hardest thing I have … I was telling Tom Cotton, it\\'s the hardest thing that I have to do. And I sign those letters, and it just, it breaks your heart. And by the way, there\\'s a time to fight. Nobody fights harder than I do. But there\\'s a time, and there\\'s not necessarily a time. But I send these letters out, quite a few. And sometimes I send letters out, it\\'s called blue on green, where we\\'re teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back. And that\\'s the hardest thing for a parent. I have all of them. I know everyone. That\\'s the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification, because they learn how their child has died. When the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them, and shoot. We\\'ve had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than we\\'ve ever had proportionately before. It\\'s a horrible, horrible thing. But I have to sign these letters. And sometimes I go out to a place, Dover Air Force Base, it\\'s a very tough experience. Mike Pence goes, I go, other people go, Tom Cotton goes. We go out there, and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the sisters, the brothers. We meet them, and we talked to them, and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin, and these things are just impossible. I don\\'t know how parents can do it, even. And I\\'ll meet them. And we have a particular Colonel, that\\'s all he does. So good. So professional. That\\'s what he does. He said, \"I greet the dead, sir. I greet the dead.\" And what happens is this big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane, and it flies in so powerful, so big. I\\'ll be talking to some of the parents, and they\\'ll act like they\\'re fine. I said, \"How are you doing?\" \"We\\'re fine, sir. We\\'re fine. We\\'re really good.\" I say, \"That\\'s great.\" And I\\'ll tell the Colonel, I\\'ll say, \"Colonel, I think they\\'re doing great.\" \"No sir, they\\'re not going to do great. You\\'ll see.\" And I didn\\'t know what he was talking about, this is the first time. Then we went outside to the runway, and this incredible machine is flying in, and it lands, and it comes over, and it pulls up, and we have military guards, we have incredible talented musicians that do this. That\\'s what they do. What happens is that door opens up, and the Colonel told me, he said, \"Sir, when that door opens up, those same people that you think are okay, do things that you\\'ll never see. You will hear sounds like you\\'ve never heard.\" That\\'s what he does. I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it. The door was opened, and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane. And I see parents make sounds, that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you\\'ve never seen before. The Colonel was telling me that, \"Sir, you\\'ll see things that you\\'ve never seen before. A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off, and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers, on top of the American flag.\" I\\'ve seen this. Then I have all these people that want to stay. They want to stay. And I don\\'t want to stay. We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. We\\'ve now been there for 10 years. We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time. We\\'re now going to be there for close to 19 years. It\\'s time to bring them home. It\\'s time to bring them home. It\\'s true. Time to bring them home. We\\'ve done our job, we\\'ve defeated everyone that we\\'re supposed to defeat. And now we are, we are policing, we are now policing. That\\'s what we\\'re doing. We\\'re policing. And that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people, and those are police, but we are now policing. We\\'re not fighting, we\\'re policing. And you know what? After all of these years … One other story, and I have to tell you. I go to Walter Reed on Friday, and I do it quite often. I gave out five Purple Hearts. And I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing. I met five warriors, and one was so badly hurt, with the loss of arms and a leg, another one … they\\'re just very, very devastated. But these are great, great people. And I gave out the Purple Heart. And I see the parents, and I have to say, Walter Reed, I want to just say, the doctors there, the job they do, you know, you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets, and the vets\\' care, and nobody\\'s done better. We got choice for the vets. We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible. But I saw these young men, and I gave them their Purple Hearts. And their parents were there crying. And one of them was so amazing. I said, \"What\\'s your problem?\" \"Sir, my face was blown apart. My nose was absolutely just blown apart.\" He said, \"Sir, it\\'s incredible.\" And I looked at him, I said, \"That\\'s the most beautiful nose I\\'ve ever seen. What do you mean?\" He said, \"A doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field. He said there were a thousand fragments.\" Now I don\\'t know if that\\'s right, but well, a lot. He meant a lot. \"He said there were a thousand fragments. He rebuilt my nose with glue. He glued the bones together. He rebuilt my nose.\" I say, \"You have the most beautiful nose I\\'ve ever seen,\" and it\\'s true. And his father came over to me, he said, \"Sir,\" father was crying, he said, \"Sir, honestly, my son looks better now.\" He said, \"My son did not have a good look. He knows. Now look at it, it\\'s beautiful, it\\'s beautiful.\" But these doctors at Walter Reed, and these Army, and Marine, and the medical doctors, they are unbelievably great people. And they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see. They see things that nobody will ever see, and there\\'s nobody like them. And I have to give a shout out to those people, there\\'s nobody like them. So in the case of Turkey, and Syria, and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey. No, you don\\'t want to do that. We could hit Turkey very hard financially. Or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. I like that. You know? Let\\'s mediate a deal. But remember they\\'ve been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case by President Obama. So we did our job. We knocked out. And I\\'ll tell you another thing, we have to be treated fairly. We have to be treated fairly. We\\'re not treated fairly by other nations. We captured many, many ISIS fighters. Most of them came from Europe. They came from Germany. They came from France. They came from all of these countries. And we called them, I called them myself in many cases, I said, \"Take your fighters.\" They said, \"We don\\'t want them. You take them.\" I said, \"No, no, no, we did you a big favor. They\\'re citizens of Germany. They\\'re citizens of France. They\\'re citizens of these various countries in Europe. Take your fighters.\" \"We don\\'t want them, sir. We don\\'t want them.\\' And I said, \"How unfair are we treated? We do them a great favor, and they won\\'t take the fighters.\" So we\\'re doing some things that are pretty amazing. Every once in a while you have to change course, and do what you have to do. The United States has spent $8 trillion in the Middle East. We\\'ve lost thousands of brave soldiers, and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same. These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed. And all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East, really it\\'s less safe, it\\'s less stable, and it\\'s less secure. And I say it all the time. The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East. We spent $8 trillion and lost thousands of lives. And by the way, the other side, we can talk about that, lost millions of lives. What did we do? So we\\'re going to pull them out, and we\\'re pulling people out, and we\\'re trying to make good deals, and we\\'re going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and they\\'ll be ready. Previous administrations lust for regime change, and also put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started. They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures. The Christians, the Christians. And we work hard with the Christians. We have tremendous evangelical support. We work hard with the Christians. So we\\'re slowly getting out of the Middle East. We\\'re doing it carefully. And we\\'re rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before. When I came into office, a very prominent general told me, because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone, said, \"Sir, we have no ammunition.\" We had old planes. We had planes that were so old, they didn\\'t fly. We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts. I never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again. I never want to have a President hear the words, \"Sir, we have no ammunition.\" Think of that. Think of that. Now, thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else than we\\'ve ever had before. And we have no choice. You look around the world, and we have no choice, unfortunately. And the Democrats want to dismantle our military. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. That\\'s what we have to do. We\\'re replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, a giant victory for our farmers, ranchers, workers in Minnesota. Congress should pass USMCA immediately. We hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense. And to protect our industrial backbone, I placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. I\\'m also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China. And the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open. And they understand that. And I don\\'t blame China for what\\'s taken place over the last 25 years. I blame the people that led our country that let that happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China. It\\'s not China\\'s fault. In the previous administration, they put our nation\\'s natural resources under lock and key, including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called Superior National Forest. Last year, I traveled to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice, reopening Superior National Forest, and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota. Tremendous jobs. And now the iron range is back in business. The last time I was here, a man came up to me, he said, \"Sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away.\\' I\\'ll never forget it. A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes. He said, \"You gave us back our life,\" because they took it away from him. We gave it back. Best iron ore there is anywhere. My administration is also fighting the Democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare. Republicans will protect Medicare, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And for those of you that have private healthcare, health insurance, 180 million people, they are going to end it, obliterate it, and most people are thrilled with it. We are going to leave it. You\\'re going to have your plan the way you want it. And there\\'s no plan like those plans. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb, right up to the moment of birth. That is why I\\'ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant Washington corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it\\'s the party of the American Dream. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You remember that? Gee, I\\'m sorry, I\\'m so sorry. Now you have a President who\\'s standing up for America, we are standing up for Minneapolis, and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota. We begin this political campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. We begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country. Together, we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. With your help, we will reelect, and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Nobody thought that could be done. Going to be done. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our great national motto, In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon. Proud citizens like the people of Minnesota helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Minnesota, I will tell you this with great certainty, the best is yet to come. Thank you very much. And just in concluding, together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you.\\nWow, that\\'s a big crowd. This is a big crowd. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello to Swanton and a load to Toledo. I\\'m thrilled to be back in Ohio with thousands of hardworking, loyal, great American patriots … days from now. Can you believe it, 43 days? We go to again win Ohio. I understand from Bob Paduchik, you know Bob? That we\\'re going to win it by more than we did. Whether we win at nine, we won by nine points. I just came into that big, beautiful place. It\\'s got more televisions in any plane in history. They\\'ve got televisions and closets and bathrooms on the floor, on the ceilings. I just saw that we\\'re tied in Ohio. I don\\'t think so … President Trump may have a slim lead in Ohio? They\\'re not even campaigning in Ohio, come to think of it. Now, they\\'re fake polls. They\\'re almost as fake as the writers themselves. They\\'re all fake. Remember last time they said, \"No, he\\'s going to lose Ohio.\" We won by nine points. So, we had seven swing states last time. President Trump is going to go home early, but it wasn\\'t president at that time, it was just Donald Trump. He will go home early. We did. That we went home early as victors, but we had nine states. They had one of the crazy papers, New York Times. They hired that guy. They paid him millions because he never predicted wrong. He was wrong. I don\\'t know if they had a contract where they could fire him, but they hired this guy. We had nine states. I was down at all of them on the day of election. I was going to lose all nine, and then guess what? I won every one of them. Fake polls. They\\'re fake polls. Then we have a crowd like this. I don\\'t know. Look, the cameras, are you turning around? These guys are bad people. I swear. They never turn the cameras around, ever. Turn them around. Turn them around. They never tell, look at them. It\\'s just like a bunch of stiffs. Real stiffs. Why don\\'t you turn the cameras around for once? You look back there, you can\\'t see it. There\\'s got to be, feels like Madison Square Garden on the ground except we have more people. Oh boy, it\\'s always tough. You know, we go through this all the time. We\\'re always asking them, look at these crowds. I mean, as far, you can\\'t see it. You have this prime territory, like you should be in the real estate business. Now, as far as the eye can see back there, the cameras don\\'t, they don\\'t get it. You only hear it from the sound. I go home. I say to the first lady, \"Did you see that crowd we had tonight in Ohio?\" She goes, \"No, no. They just keep it on your face.\" That includes Fox. They just keep it here, right here. They don\\'t want to show. You know what they don\\'t know and what they don\\'t get is that showing this kind of activity is a good thing for them. It\\'s positive for their ratings. It\\'s really a good thing, but they don\\'t want to do it, but I give up on it. You know what you do? You hear it because you can\\'t have … You know when sleepy Joe Biden, he\\'s got the circles. You knowthose big circles? You know why he has the circles? He\\'s got four of them, because they can\\'t … I mean, think of it. He is a guy who\\'s failed every time he ran. We called him 1% Joe and now he\\'s shot and he got their nomination. How the hell does that work out? How does that work out? But he\\'s got the circles. He got like four, sometimes he has six because that\\'s a good way of saying, if you don\\'t have any people, just put them in the circle and he\\'s practicing the science. Now it doesn\\'t work out, but we\\'re going to win four more years in the White House. We\\'re doing things that nobody\\'s ever done before. We\\'re doing what nobody\\'s ever done, and thank you for being here. I wish we could move the press back further, if you want to know the truth. As our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice … Thank you everybody. Thank you. So is our nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I will soon announce a nominee for the United States Supreme Court. They say it\\'s the most important thing a president can do. I don\\'t know. I think military, maybe. We rebuilt your military two and a half trillion dollars. Great. We will fill that seat. It\\'s going to go quickly. Probably announced the person. I don\\'t want to make the men too angry. It will be a woman. Is that okay? I don\\'t want to have a problem with men. They\\'ll say Trump is doing very poorly with men. You listen. How\\'s he doing? Well, he\\'s doing very poorly with men, with women. He\\'s doing very poorly with the black community, Hispanic community. Then you have the election night doing very poorly with those with diploma, without diploma, college, PhDs. What\\'s he doing well? Oh no, it\\'s going to be a very short night. Then they say Donald Trump is the projected winner by a lot. They say, well, what happened is he did very well with women did very well with men, diplomas. He did well with African American community. By the way, we are doing really well with the African American community, with the Hispanic community. We\\'re doing well with women. We\\'re doing very well. We\\'re doing well with suburbia, suburbia. I ended a regulation that will destroy suburbia. If Biden got in, they will destroy the suburbia. We call it suburbia of the world and we love it. I know it well, Westchester County, the suburban, they sometimes, if you say suburban housewife, you\\'re in deep trouble. So what you do is you say suburban women, they love me. You know why? They want security and they don\\'t want projects being right next to their house. That\\'s okay. They don\\'t want it. By the way, that includes minorities. Because 29% to 30% of these suburban communities are minorities. That includes them. They don\\'t want that. They want safe communities. They want great communities. They don\\'t want to lose the American dream. It\\'s very simple. I got rid of the regulation from Obama- Biden that was destroying suburbia. Okay? Destroying it. I think suburbia has got to wake up because if they get in, you know who\\'s in charge? You know who\\'s in charge of the program? Cory Booker, Cory Booker. Cory Booker. So, I think the suburban women and suburban men and husbands and wives and everybody, you better get smart because you\\'re not going to have your dream very much longer if they get in. If I get in, you\\'ve got it. You\\'ve also got your second amendment if I get it. In 2018, we expanded the Senate majority. Remember, they said, first of all, I wasn\\'t running. I wasn\\'t running. It makes a difference. Wait you see what happens. We\\'re going to take back the house. We\\'re going to get rid of this crazy Nancy Pelosi. Kevin McCarthy\\'s done a great job. We\\'re going to take back the house. People are so tired of her. People are so tired. Did you hear today? The latest. So, they impeached me for perfect phone call. Perfect. It was a perfect phone call. Now they want to impeach me again if I nominate somebody as I\\'m constitutionally obligated to do, to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Go ahead and I want them to do that. I want them to do that. We will. We will. We will. If he puts forth a highly qualified candidate, we will impeach him. Well, I said, \"Well, I\\'m the only guy in the world that could get impeached for trying to fill a seat in the Supreme.\" So, we\\'re going to put up our nominee who\\'s going to be outstanding. We\\'re looking at five incredible jurists, five incredible people, women that are extraordinary in every way. I mean, honestly, it could be anyone. I mean, we\\'re going to be announcing it on Friday or Saturday. Again, they say it\\'s the most important thing and think of it. So in a single term, single term, by the end of our term, we will have nominated and had confirmed I think it\\'ll end up being over 300 federal judges and hopefully three Supreme Court justices. Think of that. Three. Some presidents, they never get any. They last a long time, a lot of presidents get none. We\\'ve had three. It\\'s blowing their minds. It\\'s blowing their minds, but for the people of Ohio, this is what you want. So, it looks like we\\'re going to have three and it\\'s going to be very exciting. It\\'s exciting even from me. I\\'m going to look forward to it. Probably Saturday, we will announce the nominee and it\\'s somebody that you\\'re going to have great respect for, great respect. Thank you. Big stuff. That\\'s a big thing. They set the course of our country for many years to come, whether it\\'s on life or the second amendment or so many other things, they set the whole course of the country. Very important position, the most important. Joe Biden has refused to list the names of his potential justices because he knows they\\'re too extreme to withstand any form of public review. If Joe Biden and the Democrats take power, they will pack the Supreme Court with far left radicals who will unilaterally transform American society far beyond recognition. They will mutilate the largest figure the constitution and oppose a socialist vision from the bench that could never pass at the ballot box. So, they don\\'t want to show the judges because the only ones that he can put in are far left radicals. If he does something even towards left of center, which would be acceptable, I guess, we have no choice. If he did that, he would lose the left. So, he\\'s going to have to put in radicals. So he doesn\\'t want to show who his judges are. I\\'ve shown a list, I have a double list, about 45 from which I will only pick, but he doesn\\'t want to do that, because if you found out who he was going to pick, he would be unelectable. Hopefully, he\\'s going to be unelectable anyway. We\\'re going to find out. So, he wouldn\\'t be able to survive a Joe Biden. You wouldn\\'t be able to survive. We\\'ve been calling it socialism. I don\\'t think it\\'s socialism. I think it\\'s a step beyond what they\\'re talking about. You look at Portland, you look at Chicago, you look at New York, you look at Baltimore and Oakland. These are Democrat run cities that are horrible in crime. There\\'s no law and order, no cash bail, no anything. You know what? The Republican cities are running great. They\\'re running great. So, we\\'re going to get it all changed around. We went into Minneapolis, we solved the problem like you wouldn\\'t believe. What did it take? You saw it. What did that take? I would say probably 30 minutes. Right? They should have called us in about seven days earlier. How about the reporter? He gets up there, behind him is a burning city. I never saw anything like it. He\\'s saying, \"There are really no protests here. This is very friendly.\" We call this a friendly protester because you\\'re not supposed to have political rallies. You\\'re not supposed to have anything. The only thing you can have is thousands of people running down a street burning stores, looting, doing what … That\\'s okay, because that\\'s protesting, but we\\'ll call this a friendly protest, but your children will be robbed of their future and the damage will endure for generations to come- … future the damage we\\'ll endure for generations to come. We have to win. This is the most important election in the history of our country in my opinion. And a lot of that\\'s got to do with the fact that we\\'re going to have one extra, but we didn\\'t think this was going to happen. But I used to say just a week ago, \"We\\'re going to have one, two, three, four, and maybe even five, the next President, and the Supreme Court is going to be a tremendous factor.\" A lot of people said that\\'s the reason I won so easily in the Electoral College last time. 306, 306 to 223. \"He will not get to 270.\" Remember? \"He will not get to 270. This will be a short evening for Donald Trump. Oh, good riddance. Thank God we got rid of him. Oh, this is going to be great.\" And then that problem happened. \"Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio.\" Remember the one, she was crying? She was crying. \"Donald Trump has won Ohio.\" But it wasn\\'t winning Ohio, it was by the margin. \"Where the hell?\" he said, \"Where did this margin come from?\" They opened the polls. Then they closed the polls. Normally you have to wait hours, unless it\\'s a total runaway. And they said, \"Ah, the polls and the doors are closed in Ohio. Donald Trump has won.\" And they go, \"Oh my God. But wait a minute. He won by nine points. What the hell\\'s going on over here?\" Then they said, \"Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Georgia. Donald Trump has won North Carolina, South Carolina.\" Remember that? Was that the most exciting evening, really? Remember? And it\\'s not Donald Trump. It\\'s you. It\\'s all of us. They use the name Donald Trump. It\\'s all of us have won. And this one\\'s going to be even better because nobody has done, and then don\\'t even challenge it, the fake news, nobody has done in three and a half years what we\\'ve done. We\\'ve rebuilt our military. Two and a half trillion dollars. We\\'ve taken care of our vets. We have choice, we have accountability. We can fire people now when they\\'re not treating our vets right. We couldn\\'t do that before. They could treat our vets terribly. We have accountability. Nobody has done what we\\'ve done for our vets. 91% approval rating at the VA. 91%, the highest ever. So nobody\\'s done it, and that\\'s why I think this is going to be the most important of all. I used to say, \"Well, I don\\'t know. How does it compare to 2016?\" I just gave that up. This is the most important election. You know why? Two reasons. Number one, that\\'s over with, the hell with it. The hell with it. But the truth is it\\'s got a seat in, and we have a lot of new things including additional, substantial, middle income tax cuts and other tax cuts, and tremendous regulation cuts. And we\\'re finishing up with our military. We\\'re building Space Force. The wall is going incredibly. You remember the wall? They don\\'t talk about the wall anymore, the fake news. Once we started building it, if you think that was easy to build the wall, we had an entire party that would die for the fact, and I made a terrible mistake in the wall, instead of telling you, \"We\\'re going to build a wall, we\\'re going to build a wall,\" the Democrats formed, it was very tough, but I got it. I\\'m a real estate developer. You can always get money. You learn we have a lot of little pockets. We had a lot of big pockets. But the military was great. The Army Corps of Engineers were great. So we\\'re up to 330 miles of wall. We\\'re doing 10 miles a week, and we\\'re going to be finished with the wall very soon. And it\\'s exactly the wall, the little more expensive wall, they want like nice, expensive, but exactly what border patrol wanted. We\\'re building them the exact wall that they want. We can\\'t give them any excuses. We can\\'t give them any excuses. But it\\'s true, they used to talk about the wall all the time because they never thought I\\'d be able to get a bill. Once I got it going, got it built, I got the financing, we won a lot of lawsuits, by the way, we won a lot of lawsuits. They sued us. Pelosi was suing us. Congress was suing us. The Senate was suing us. We won a lot of lawsuits. Once it was obvious that we won and we started building, they never talk about the wall anymore. And I made a terrible, terrible mistake because I had to work my ass off to get that thing built. You have no idea. You have no idea. You have no idea. But I should have said, the mistake, I should have said when I talked to these big crowds, and the crowds are getting bigger, there\\'s more enthusiasm now than we ever had four years ago, but I should have said, instead of, \"We will build a wall,\" I kept, \"We will build a wall,\" place would go crazy, I should have said, \"We will not build the wall. Under no circumstances, will we build a wall,\" the Democrats would have given us all the money we wanted. It\\'s true. It\\'s true. And then they would have said, \"See, he didn\\'t keep his campaign promise.\" These people are sick. The Biden nominated justices will shred our Second Amendment, eliminate the right to self defense, and allow the government to confiscate your privately owned firearms. You know that. Put in other language, they will end your Second Amendment. And they will do that. By the way, if I wasn\\'t here, you wouldn\\'t have a Second Amendment right now. That would be gone. I hate to say it. I\\'m the only thing standing between you and chaos, I\\'m telling you. And Second Amendment and all of the other things. Biden\\'s justices will remove the words \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance. Did you see that? Did you see it? They said, \"No, we\\'d never remove. And I saw it, they\\'re doing the Pledge of Allegiance. And I said, \"Oh, it must be a typo.\" They left the words \"under God\" out of the Pledge of Allegiance, the Democrats. And I said, \"Oh, there\\'s a typo. Typo, they made a mistake. What a stupid mistake. Can you believe it? That guy\\'s in big trouble. What a stupid mistake.\" And then I heard it a second time. They did the same mistake. That\\'s what they\\'re doing. They\\'re going to take God out of everything just like they want to knock down the statue of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. That\\'s never happening. It\\'s never happening. A lot of these Democrats states, you see it, the churches are closed. They don\\'t want our churches to open. You can have a riot where you kill people in the streets. 25,000 people don\\'t have to wear a mask, nothing. They can march down the streets, step on each other\\'s face, they can do whatever the hell they want, that\\'s okay. But you can\\'t go to church. They have ideas, they have plans, and it\\'s never happening with me as your President. That I can tell you. And you see it, they want to tear down crosses from public spaces. You see it. Since I signed a little law, they were ripping down a lot of statues about four months ago, and I said, \"Do we have any laws, like old laws when they was strong, when we were smart, when we were tough?\" \"Sir, we have one, sir.\" A General came in. \"What\\'s the law, General?\" \"Sir, there was a law from quite a while ago, 10 years in prison.\" They didn\\'t use the word jail, prison. Prison\\'s a tougher word. I said, \"What do you mean, 10 years?\" \"You get 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue or if you knock down a monument.\" I said, \"General, let me see that sucker, please. Bring that to my office.\" And we revived it because you can\\'t get that approved by Congress. They would never. Today in Congress, you\\'d do it, they\\'ll give you half a day in a hotel someplace. So 10 years. So they were having a big march on Washington in two days and I signed this new law. We updated it, and it was 10 years. You get 10 years in prison. You touch, you knock down a monument. And there\\'s no games. This is the old days. This is the days when we had strong laws, when we had real laws, when we had real politicians that knew how to make laws. So here\\'s the thing. So they weren\\'t going to come in, they were actually looking to knock down the statue of a man named Thomas Jefferson. That\\'s not too good. They had obliterated a lot of different things. And so I had a news conference. I announced that I\\'m signing a law that anybody that knocks down a monument or a statue gets 10 years in jail. And the police in Washington, and we had National Guard, we had Secret Service. We were all ready for them. We were ready for them. And the time came, there\\'s was only a problem, nobody showed up. You know why? 10 years was too much. 10 years was too much. It\\'s amazing the way. Isn\\'t it amazing the way it all works? So instead they burned down Portland. I speak to the Governor. The mayor is hopeless. He\\'s a hopeless, poor guy. They chased him out of his apartment, and he still thinks they\\'re wonderful people. They\\'re burning down his city. But I want to go in there with the National Guard so bad. It would take us 15 minutes to solve the problem. When they heard in Seattle that we were going in, we were going in the next day, the guys just walked away. They left. That was the end of it. We had nothing to do. But they want to ban all prayer in public schools and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. Biden\\'s justices will erase national borders, they don\\'t want borders, protect sanctuary cities, and compel the unlimited entry of foreign nationals. And if you look at some of these jihadist nations, no thank you. Somebody said, \"That\\'s not nice. That\\'s not politically correct.\" I said, \"That\\'s okay.\" They\\'ll clip all the police departments, free violent criminals, shield foreign terrorists, and declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers who kill women and children. That\\'s what they want. They don\\'t want any death penalty. Not for the Boston Bomber, not for anybody. You see the Boston Bomber, they\\'re still trying this guy, what he did to so many lives. He killed people, ruined so many families, ruined so many lives. And by the way, they want the Boston Bomber to be able to vote. You know that. In three and a half years under my administration, we\\'ve secured America\\'s borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and brought jobs and factories back to the great state of Ohio. I love Ohio. I love Ohio. I don\\'t know what it is. I was told by Bob and some of the Congressmen that are here, we have some great ones, I\\'m going to introduce them in a second, but I was told that they\\'re not even trying for Ohio. You know why? Because I love you and you love me, and that\\'s the way it is. That\\'s the way it is. Thank you. I love you too. It\\'s very interesting. So somebody in the fake news media did a story yesterday because there\\'s crazy chances going on. They have too about the seat and all that. But there was another chant that\\'s happening at all these rallies. We\\'re having massive rallies. We\\'re in Minnesota. We had a tremendous crowd. Wisconsin, tremendous. Pennsylvania, every one of them. I mean, in all fairness, it\\'s like this, everyone. But this rant is going on like it\\'s crazy. And it\\'s, \"We love you. We love you. We love you,\" and you know what? I don\\'t want to say it. I\\'m just saying, they have not been able to find in the history of politics in this nation, even we loved Ronald Reagan, but they have not been able to find where people broke out and said, \"We love you,\" about, I guess I have to call myself a politician. I don\\'t feel like a politician. How nice is that? I never heard it. I\\'ve been to a lot of different speeches and rallies. I\\'ve never heard crowds go, \"We love you.\" But you know why? We love you. I love you. But you know why? Because, again, nobody has done what we\\'ve done. Ohio had the best year in its history last year. We had a great year. And next year, assuming we win, which I hope we\\'re going to win, but if we win, you\\'re going to have a year next year. First of all, take a look at the third quarter. It\\'s going to be announced the numbers just before the election. They\\'ll come out three days before the election. And I\\'ll tell you what, I\\'ll bet on the numbers, even though Crazy Nancy and these people don\\'t want to give any stimulus, they don\\'t want to give anything. They want to keep a lot of states closed wherever they can. You know what they\\'re going to do? They\\'re going to announce they\\'re going to be opening on November 4th. There\\'ll be open. All these closed states, they\\'re going to be open on November 4th. One of them blue and a teacher\\'s union. Did you see it? \"No, we don\\'t want to open now. We don\\'t want to open. The pandemic. We don\\'t want to.\" We\\'re rounding the turn on the pandemic. Vaccines are coming soon. \"But we don\\'t want to open. Around November 4th we\\'re going to open.\" This person that\\'s a judge of a union said that. That was not good. I think they\\'ll get rid of her quickly. I\\'m also proud that we have successfully brought back the Big 10 and the Ohio State Buckeyes. You better have a good year after all of that. You have a good team, right? Good coach. Good team. Good everything. You have a good team. You always have a good team. But there was a case, what do I know? I said, \"How\\'s it going? Everything good? Are you struggling?\" They said, \"Sir, Sleepy Joe Biden did an ad that you,\" me, \"that you closed football.\" I said, \"What do you mean I closed? I didn\\'t close.\" The guy did an ad. It\\'s called disinformation. It\\'s called the opposite of what the fact is. Not only didn\\'t I close it, I didn\\'t think about it too much, okay? The states should all be open. But I heard about Big 10 football, and because of this ad, I said, \"Hey, wait a minute. I have an idea.\" It was a fake ad, just like the ad on the grave sites, and that allows me to say that this man is a gross incompetent. He has no idea. Because now, see, I would never talk like that, but when I saw that horrible thing, and nobody\\'s done more for the military than I have, when I saw that horrible ad, \"An anonymous source has said that Donald Trump said this,\" I have 28 people now that have come forward saying it\\'s a total lie, they don\\'t care, so they did an ad, once they did that, I said, \"Well, now the gloves are off.\" Let\\'s face it, Joe Biden is incompetent. He always was even in prime time. he was incompetent in prime time. And now he\\'s really incompetent. But because of the ad, I said, \"It\\'s very interesting, that ad, it\\'s very interesting. Let me call up the Commissioner.\" I had called up the Commissioner, very good guy, and I said, \"Commissioner, what can we do to get Big 10 football back?\" \"Well, I don\\'t know.\" And we started a little thing, the Commissioner and myself, one of my guys, he\\'s fantastic, and within a few days, it started getting talked about, and then we kept it going and we helped him with some testing because we have the greatest testing in the world. We get no credit for it. We\\'ve tested almost 100 million people. India is second with 38th and they have 1.5 billion people, slightly more than you. But I will tell you, so all of a sudden they have schools. Then looked like it was going to open without Michigan and without a couple of states. And then all of a sudden the pressure became so great, and the full league is opening now and it\\'s going to be very exciting. And I will tell you, it\\'s not a question of taking credit, but truly we were the ones that did that. I mean, it was. I\\'ll tell you when I do it and when I don\\'t. But it was closed, it was gone, it was announced that it was closed. And what really spurred me on was when Sleepy Joe announced that I was the one that did it. I said, \"I didn\\'t even know it was closed.\" But once I found out it was, I called the Commissioner. He was really good, I tell you. And we called a couple of the top people at the universities and they got it going. It looked like we had seven schools, eight schools. All of a sudden, everybody fell into line. I think they\\'re all open now. Every one of them is participating. So I want to thank the Commissioner. I want to thank all of those schools. May the best team win. In other words, Ohio State. That\\'s a good team. You know who the best proponents were? The players and especially the parents of the players. These kids have a short window to get into the NFL to create some excitement and how good they are. And you have a lot of potential players, but they couldn\\'t play football. And they said, \"We\\'re safer on the field than we are staying at home,\" and they meant it. And we did something and I\\'m happy about it. So enjoy the football, enjoy it. Under 16 years of Presidents Obama and Bush, median household income rose only $2,945. So remember that. That\\'s 16 years, 2009, so let\\'s say 3000. Under three years of President Trump, it rose almost $7,000. So think of that, 16 years. Three years, achieving the highest median income in the history of our country. In my first three years, we lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, the largest poverty reduction of any President in the history of our country. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we are doing it again. We\\'re building it again. I see the signs \"Make America Great Again,\" so I say this, it\\'s called now \"Make America Great Again. Again\". Because we did it and then we had to close it up. We saved millions of lives. If we didn\\'t do that, you would have had three million people. It would have been terrible. It\\'s terrible anyway. They shouldn\\'t have allowed it to happen, China. To defeat the China Virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War Two. Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate- Through pioneering therapies, we reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that. That\\'s remdesivir and all of the things, the plasma, all different things. Where do you see what\\'s coming out? Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. That\\'s before today\\'s big breakout. You know they had a big breakout in Europe and they keep saying in the fake news, they keep saying about, \"Oh, Europe, Europe, Europe.\" Well, we\\'re doing better than Europe. I hate to see what happened, and it had a big impact on the market today because it was a bad thing. But they had a big hit and they\\'ll take care of it. They know how to do it. They\\'ll take care of it. We\\'re working very closely with Europe and other countries, including on the vaccine. We have three vaccines right now that are right there. They\\'re right at the starting gate and they\\'re going to be fantastic. So it\\'s good. With Biden, if you had that regime, you\\'d be three years away because it would have never gotten out of the FDA. What we\\'ve done in a very safe manner is amazing. Now remember this, Biden was in charge of the swine flu, right? It\\'s called the H1N1. Remember he calls it the N1H1. I said, \"No, no, no, no.\" H comes before the N. It\\'s so easy. But he goes, \"The N1H1.\" We say, \"No.\" But it\\'s the swine flu. Maybe we just call it the swine flu. He did such a gross, horrible job on that. His own man who was in charge of it said they didn\\'t have a clue. They didn\\'t know what they were doing. It was a much less lethal disease and they lost many, many people. Many, many people. It was totally incompetently. And now I got this guy standing up. Well, we\\'re giving him advice. His own guy that ran it. Did everybody see this? They\\'re saying they didn\\'t have a clue what they were doing. It was so bad. I don\\'t know why the hell he said it, to be honest with you. Who would say that? Maybe because he was honest. Does that make sense? Now Biden gets up and he\\'s saying to do the same things as we\\'ve already done. He basically took our plan and he said, \"This is what you should do.\" But we have among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world and the fastest economic recovery by far of any Western nation by far. Our bold and early action saved millions of lives and our decisive economic response saved tens of millions of jobs, including 1.9 million jobs in the state of Ohio. You know that? He knows it. He\\'s got one of them. He\\'s got one of them. Through operation warp speed, we\\'re developing these great vaccines. And that\\'s going to be… Literally, these will be done in record time. Like nobody\\'s ever done it before. On November 3rd, Ohio will decide whether we end the pandemic and return to record prosperity or whether we allow sleepy Joe Biden and his group of incompetence to delay the vaccine, shut down the country. He actually suggested that he would shut down the country. We now know the disease. We didn\\'t know it. Now we know it affects elderly people with heart problems and other problems. If they have other problems, that\\'s what it really affects. That\\'s it. You know, in some States, thousands of people, nobody young below the age of 18, like nobody. They have a strong immune system. Who knows? Take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system, but it affects virtually nobody. It\\'s an amazing thing. By the way, open your schools. Everybody open your schools. Sleepy Joe Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax site, ban American energy, destroy the suburbs, give free healthcare to illegal aliens. How about that one? You know the bad part about that? We all have heart. We want to take care of people. Probably that is everybody\\'s going to come to the United States. People that weren\\'t even thinking about it, they\\'re going to say, \"Oh man, these idiots are giving free healthcare, free college education. They\\'re giving free everything. They\\'re giving a Rolls Royce to every family that enters through the Southern border.\" Remember I said that jokingly and CNN said, \"He misrepresented. They are not getting a Rolls Royce.\" I agree. Now they\\'re sick. They are sick. And indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies. They\\'re doing that. We\\'re stopping it. To combat the toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we\\'re launching a pro-American lesson plan for students called 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth and we are getting better and better all the time. We got to. No party can lead America that will not teach our children to love America. Biden\\'s running mate, Kamilla. Who likes Kamilla? Does anybody like her? She was the most failed candidate. I mean, she started off good. And every week she went down, down 15 points, 12 points, 11 points, 9 points, six points, five points, four points, two points. Didn\\'t she leave at about two or one? She was heading down to the basement. She was so mean to him. I felt sorry for him. No, I did. I felt sorry. So she called them everything from a racist to a MeTooer. He was MeToo. He was a part of the MeToo generation. What she called him, what she said. So I brilliantly said, \"Well, he can\\'t pick Pocahontas because she was too nasty. How nasty was she to Bloomberg? Was she unbelievable? Boy, he was standing there. What happened? What happened? No, actually. What happened? Mini Mike. He\\'s another beauty. He\\'s a real beauty. Mini Mike, what happened? What the hell happened? He hit her so hard. Remember? She hits him with about 30 different things, and I\\'m not talking about our president. He thought she was talking about me. Can you believe it? And I\\'m not talking. I\\'m talking about you. He said, \"Get me out of here. Get me out of here.\" And now he wants to buy his way back into the Democrat party. He wants to buy his way back into the Democrats. He hasn\\'t taken enough abuse. If I were him, I\\'d sort of either ride it out or stay with the good Trump economy and get even richer. Biden\\'s running made even urged supporters to help the bail riders out of jail. You saw that? Including one who attempted to murder a police officer and a man accused of sexually assaulting an eight year old child. Now they\\'re trying to free them on bail. They\\'re putting up the money to get them out by this plan to appease the domestic terrorist. And that\\'s what it is. My plan is to arrest the domestic terrorist, and that\\'s what we\\'re doing for many people in jail. Many people. Remember what I told you about the monuments? This is remembrance. Isn\\'t it beautiful? We don\\'t see that anymore. Have you seen a monument knocked down recently? No, we don\\'t see it anymore. I don\\'t know. We want to rip down Abraham Lincoln. It got to Lincoln. First, it was not too many people heard of him. Confederate soldiers, et cetera. You say, \"Hey, look, do it through a process.\" But they started hitting Lincoln. Then they hit Gandhi. Now Gandhi was about peace. Gandhi just wanted peace. Leave me alone. Peace, peace, peace. Let\\'s rip them down. They\\'re sick people. The Democrat party\\'s war on cops has already led to a surge in vicious murders in Democrat control cities costing countless black lives. If Biden and the left gain power, they will dismantle police departments nationwide. I\\'ll tell you, the community that\\'s most hurt, most hurt by what they\\'re doing and there is the black community, the Hispanic community. And we\\'re doing great in the polls with the black community and the Hispanic community. And the Asian community. We\\'re doing great. In fact, we did so well last night on one poll, they said it must be a typo. They did. It must be an error. It wasn\\'t. It\\'s no error. You\\'re going to find out on November 3rd it\\'s no error. As president, I always stand and I will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. They\\'re great people. They\\'re very brave people. Not easy, and they don\\'t get support. We have to give them back their dignity. We have to let them do their job. That\\'s very simple. They\\'re great. We\\'re joined tonight by two high school football players. They became very, very famous. They became more famous than President Trump. They were beautiful. I watched them running through the crowds with those flags. Here\\'s some place, I don\\'t know, you got a lot of people here. We\\'re going to try and figure it out. Hold up your flag. Jared Bentley and Brady Williams, who were recently suspended from their high school football team after displaying flags in support of our police and first responders on the anniversary of September 11th attacks. Where are they? Come up here, fellas. Come up. Come up here. Come up here. Secret Service is thrilled about this. See, these young kids can hop over the fence like it\\'s nothing. Come up here. They\\'re good looking kids. I want to congratulate you. You become famous. They\\'re going to go to Hollywood. They\\'re going to become movie actors right now. Right? You feel good about it? How\\'s your team doing? How\\'s your team? How\\'s it doing? He said it could be better. You know what? You\\'re doing great. And everybody out here loves you and they appreciate you. You did a great job. Good job, fella. Good job. Good luck. Is your arm okay? Good. You all right? Good. Good guys. Good guys. Jared and Brady, thank you for supporting the heroes in our law enforcement. We all love you. I\\'m telling you. You really set something up that\\'s incredible, and thank your parents for letting you do it. I watched. You ask your parents approval. Isn\\'t that nice? You know what the father said? \"You better do it.\" Right? That\\'s great. Thank you very much, fellas. Great job. Really great job. Country has a lot of respect. Speaking about warriors, we\\'re also joined tonight by some great, great congressmen who are warriors and they represent Ohio so well and they love you and they love our country. Representative Bob Latta. Thank you, Bob. Great job. They like you, Bob. That\\'s very good. Good job, Bob. Thank you very much. Congressman Warren Davidson. You know Warren. Thank you, Warren. Great job, Warren. Congressman Mike Turner. A great lawyer, actually. Thank you, Mike. Great job, Mike. You\\'re really great. Ohio treasurer Robert Sprague. Robert, thank you. Thanks. Good treasurer. Ohio auditor Keith Faber. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Keith. Ohio House speaker, Bob Cupp. Where is he? Thank you, Bob. Great job. Ohio Senate president, Larry Obhof. Thank you. Thank you, Larry Obhof. Larry is a good man. How\\'s it going, Larry? Good. You\\'re doing a good job. Huh? You\\'re doing good. How are we doing, Larry? Is it going good? You\\'re right about that. You\\'re doing a great job. Thanks, Larry. I appreciate it. Ohio GOP chairman Jane Timken. She\\'s unbelievable. Thank you, Jane. How are we doing, Jane? How\\'s it going? How does it compare to four years ago, Jane? Up higher. All right. Good. Good. I think we are. I think we are. A friend of mine that I\\'ll tell you, this is the greatest optimist. When I thought we had to be down, we lost a lot of the top, top support. The head of the Republican party, little things like that. I said, \"We don\\'t have a head of the Republican party. He left because you had a terrible governor in this state.\" Terrible. Your previous governor was terrible. He was terrible. I\\'ll tell you, I got this man. I didn\\'t know him. Within about a week, I said, \"Man, this guy\\'s a big optimist.\" And he was right. He called it right to the thing. He ran my campaign. When he came back for the second time, we had him in a high position. I said, \"Bob, I think you\\'re great. You\\'re doing a great job. I want you back in Ohio. We have to do it again.\" Bob Paduchik. Where\\'s Bob? Thank you. Thank you, Bob. Get over here, Bob. Thank you, Bob. He wants no glamor. He wants no glory. He just wants to win. He called it right down to the bone. We had a rough couple of days. I said, \"Bob, how we doing?\" \"You went up two points.\" I said, \"You got to be kidding.\" But we did. So much evolves around Ohio and it\\'s just a state that we have a relationship with. It\\'s a great state. We\\'ve done a great job for you and you\\'ve done a great job for us. So we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Together, we\\'ve spent the last four years reversing the damage done by the Democrats and Joe Biden over a 47 year period. Think of it. He\\'s always talking about, \"You should have done this. You should have done that.\" He really just left office. It\\'s not that long ago, right? He\\'s been there for years and years and now he should have done. He\\'s never going to do anything. He\\'s never going to do anything. Guy is a stone cold loser. Biden supported every globalist sellout of Ohio workers for over a half a century, including NAFTA, China\\'s entry into the World Trade Organization, the disaster known as TPP and how about the Paris Climate Accord? That\\'s another beauty. I\\'ll tell you, that was designed to hurt our country. You would have lost trillions of dollars, closed your factories all over the place. In the meantime, China didn\\'t kick in for another 10 years. The whole thing was a rigged deal. I tell you, I said, \"I\\'m going to get killed for this one, but we\\'re going to terminate.\" And you know what? The people got it right away. Everybody understood. That was another rip off of our country. This state lost one in three manufacturing jobs after the NAFTA and China disasters. Joe Biden is a shameless phony who pretends… He doesn\\'t have a clue. What the hell? We\\'re talking like he knows. He\\'s got guys around him that are pretty smart. They\\'re radical left. He\\'s going to do whatever they tell him to do. He pretends to care about blue collar workers. After spending more than five decades in Washington, he tells me, \"Why didn\\'t you do this? Why didn\\'t you do that?\" You see these fake commercials. \"Why didn\\'t you do it?\" I said, \"I\\'ve only been here three and a half years. This guy has been here for 47 years. He didn\\'t do anything.\" My actions saved countless jobs across Ohio and here in Toledo, the home of the Jeep, right? The home of the Jeep. That\\'s good. That\\'s a great brand. They\\'ve done a great job with Jeep. Jeep. Everyone loves Jeep. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to Ohio when we ended the NAFTA nightmare. I proudly signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement in July. That\\'s a big difference. Like day and night. It\\'s working out great too. It\\'s working out great. You know how I know that it\\'s a good deal for us? Because they don\\'t like it. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China\\'s rampant theft of Ohio jobs. We achieved American energy. We passed record tax cuts and regulations. Our energy independence is incredible. We have now energy independence. We don\\'t have to be in these far away lands anymore. Now we\\'ll be there to help certain allies that have been great, but we don\\'t have to be. Since my election, natural gas production in Ohio has surged 63%. They want to close it up. By the way, you do know they want to close it up. They want to close up all fracking natural gas ever. They want to close it up. This would kill at least 700,000 Ohio jobs. Probably more than a million. While I\\'m president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas and Ohio workers will continue leading the way. I just left the great state of Texas, and I talked to a lot of people like this, a great crowd of people. We have tremendous support all over the country. I\\'ll tell you what. These people are great. And here\\'s the platform that they have. Sleepy Joe Biden. No oil, no religion, no God, and no guns. Now I\\'m in Texas. It\\'s a really rough thing in Ohio, but now we\\'re talking Texas. No oil, that doesn\\'t work well in Texas, right? No guns. That doesn\\'t work well in Texas. No God. Look what they\\'re doing to the churches and everything. That doesn\\'t work. No God. No religion. That doesn\\'t work well. You would have to be George Washington with your running mate would be Abraham Lincoln. Okay. Your VP candidate. And you\\'d still lose very big. And then they say- … and you\\'d still lose very big. And then they say, \"Yeah, he\\'s doing okay. He\\'s two up in Texas.\" They said it last time too, that Texas is even, four years ago. And everybody said, \"No, I think Trump is killing it.\" We\\'d have stadiums with 25,000, 30,000 people, much more that couldn\\'t get in. We\\'d have 40,000, 50,000 people outside and they\\'d say I was even. We won in a landslide, just like we won this state, in a landslide. You know the expression they use, \"Texas is in play.\" You know what \"in play\" means? It could go either way. And guys would get on there and say, \"I don\\'t think so.\" And then that night again, \"The polls in Texas have closed. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas.\" I mean, the whole thing is crazy. It\\'s crazy, it\\'s crazy. You know what they do? It\\'s suppression polls. They try and depress you. They try and make you unhappy so you go out to dinner with your wife, your husband, you go out to dinner, \"Darling, let\\'s have dinner. It\\'s so sad. We love Donald, but he just can\\'t make it. He can\\'t make it. Let\\'s go out, have dinner. We\\'ll come home and watch the results.\" Except 2016 came and nobody did that, they all went out and voted and we kicked ass. Tell me, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? Did you ever see the ratings, the combined ratings? I think the biggest ever. But was that the most exciting? 2016, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, including more than $6 billion in contracts. I\\'ll tell you what, you like the word pronounced Lima or Lima, because I saved Lima. And I tell you what, I saved Lima. I came here and they were going to close that plant in Lima. They were going to close the tank plant. It was done. And I said, \"Why are we closing a tank plant?\" And I got a couple of calls from my friends, the Congressman right here. And I got calls. And Jim Jordan called me. Do you like Jim Jordan? He\\'s great. And I looked at this army tank plant in Lima. I said, \"Why are we closing it?\" And I saw the people building the tanks and the technology\\'s incredible. And if you ever closed it, you\\'d never be able to open a thing like that again. So I overrode the generals, I overrode everybody, and now we\\'re making a record number of tanks in that plant and it\\'s absolutely thriving. But we had tremendous success. We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. We took out the world\\'s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many other people. Qasem Soleimani is dead. He\\'s dead. I withdrew from last administration\\'s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. They paid $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash. You know they got? Nothing. They got nothing. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. Every president for many, many decades said they were going to do it. They never did it. They never did it. They didn\\'t have the guts to do it. They campaigned on it, they were all going to do it. Then they got there, there was a lot of pressure put on them. A lot of pressure put on me. Every leader was calling all over. \"Please don\\'t do it. Please don\\'t do it. Mr. President, please don\\'t do it. Don\\'t do it. Don\\'t move it. Just leave it the way it is. It\\'s okay.\" But I promised and I said, \"I\\'m going to do it.\" And then I got calls from the biggest people in the world. Kings, I got calls from presidents, from prime ministers, \"Please, please don\\'t tell it.\" Then I got calls, \"Please have him call me back me,\" me. I said, \"Look, tell everybody I\\'m out for three days. I\\'m not going to be able to call them back.\" I had a news conference, we announced it. Then I called everybody back. \"Hey, how you doing? How\\'s everything going? Everything going good?\" \"Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but it\\'s too late. You already did it.\" And we did it and we got it done and nobody else got it done. And it\\'s something we had to do. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace all over the Middle East. And you saw that. And I\\'m the only man that got nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and I didn\\'t get any press. They wouldn\\'t. For two of them. Last week, I\\'m not bragging about it, I\\'m just saying, I\\'m the President of the United States because of Kosovo-Serbia, they\\'ve been killing each other for years, I worked out a deal for them. I got nominated. And then Israel with Bahrain and UAE, and many more to come. I mean, they all want to do it. We\\'ll have peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand. No blood. We\\'re going to have peace in the Middle East. So I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And I told this story last night. Should I tell it or not? Should I? Yes. She wants me to do it. So I go home to our great First Lady. I said, \"First Lady, you\\'re going to be so proud of me tonight. I was nominated not once but twice for totally separate events by different people.\" Great people. \"First lady, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\" I was like this. \"I was nominated.\" It\\'s a big deal for our country, right? And she said, \"Oh, that\\'s good.\" I said, \"Let\\'s turn on the evening news. Let\\'s watch it. This is going to be a big show tonight. Get ready.\" And NBC, which is one of the most crooked, one of the worst newscasts, and I\\'m talking about normal NBC, not MSDNC. MSDNC is the worst. So I turned on NBC with Lester Holt, another beauty. And they start with a hurricane and then they went to something, and something else. And I\\'m saying, \"First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing. We\\'re 20 minutes into a half hour show. They haven\\'t mentioned the Nobel Peace Prize.\" And then it went through the whole show and they never mentioned. Then I got nominated for a second one. They never mentioned. And when Barack Obama, Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, now when Barack Hussein Obama got nominated, he didn\\'t know why he was nominated. It was like right at the very beginning. He didn\\'t do anything. He did nothing and he got nominated. It was the biggest story I\\'ve ever seen. But that\\'s okay. In the meantime, we\\'re President and they\\'re not. No, that\\'s right. You would think if you nominated for the Nobel Prize, you\\'d get maybe half a second. The First Lady, she said, \"Sorry, darling. That\\'s the way it goes, isn\\'t it?\" Joe Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He voted for the Iraq War disaster. He backed the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal. And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for our country. \"Oh, it\\'s really great.\" If it were up to Sleepy Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would be alive today, ISIS would be on a rampage, Iran would control the Middle East, and China would be the dominant power anywhere in the world. And I want to tell you, if you go back a few months before this pandemic, we were gaining, gaining, gaining. We had an insurmountable lead on China. I always heard they were going to catch us by 2019 for 10 years. We were so far beyond, we were doing much better than they were. The Biden agenda would obliterate our economy. He destroyed social security, destroyed protections for pre-existing conditions. That\\'s what he\\'s going to do, drain your Medicare by giving away your healthcare to illegal immigrants. He would end our travel ban to jihadist regions and increase refugee admissions by, listen to this, over 700%. And this is the manifesto with Bernie Sanders, with Crazy Bernie. He made this deal with Crazy Bernie. And by the way, a lot of the Crazy Bernie voters last time, four years ago, voted for Trump because of trade, because the one thing they do understand, that our country has been off for years. Biden opposes school choice and vowed to ban charter schools. Very important to have them. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. They\\'re totally against it. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just, in conclusion, first of all, it\\'s been a great honor to be with you. This is, really, it\\'s a great state. They\\'re great people. I really mean it. No, I really mean it. Get out there on November 3rd. We\\'ve got to win this one big. This is a bad, bad ideology. This is probably a step beyond socialism. I really think in many ways, it\\'s communism we\\'re talking about. This is a step beyond. Socialism\\'s no good. Communism\\'s really bad. But get out there on November 3rd and let\\'s show him your stuff and show them the stuff of all of us. So, in concluding, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end the reliance, this ridiculous, crazy reliance on China, and all of these far away lands once and for all. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police. And by the way, thank you, police. Thank you, law enforcement. Increased penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, stupid, endless, foreign wars. We will maintain America\\'s unrivaled military. Our military might has never been like it is right now because of what we\\'ve done. And we had no choice, and hope to God we never have to use it, because if you would ever see the power of what we\\'ve done over the last three years, it\\'s almost better for you not to see it. We are the envy of every power, every country in the world. We have weapons that nobody ever even thought possible. And just as I said, hope to God we never have to use them. And the way we don\\'t have to use them is to keep that kind of strength. Nobody\\'s going to be talking to us. We\\'re going to have peace through strength, and it\\'s all made in the U.S.A. Made in the U.S.A. We\\'ll end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I\\'ve already signed it into law. Kicks in on January 1st. It\\'s going to cut your bills down to a level that you wouldn\\'t believe. That doesn\\'t mean the drug companies and the hospital and corporations are happy with me. But that\\'s okay. And further reduce health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs by 50%, 60% and 70%. Big pharma does not like me too much. They\\'re taking ads about me that are so bad, but you get it, you understand it. They\\'re not too thrilled with me, including the rebates. The rebates go back to you. The rebates before went back to very rich people. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That\\'s what\\'s happening. NASA is again the leading space station anywhere in the world. There\\'s nothing like a space center, what we\\'ve done. And there was grass growing in the runways when I took over three and a half years ago. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, \"In God we trust.\" For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great state of Ohio. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your co-workers, get everybody, and get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. And in your state, in Ohio, early voting has already begun and don\\'t wait. And when you see them cheating on the other side, I don\\'t say if, when, when you see them cheating with those ballots, all of those unsolicited ballots, those millions of ballots, you\\'ll see them, anytime you do, report them to the authorities. The authorities awaiting and watching. From Akron to Columbus, from Cincinnati to Queen City, I know it weller than Cleveland, and from Dayton to Toledo, we inherit the legacy of generations of Ohio patriots, like Neil Armstrong, Annie Oakley, William McKinley, and the amazing Ulysses S. Grant, that\\'s good. Nobody\\'s stock has gone up like Grant. Nobody in the last 10 years. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and you haven\\'t seen anything yet. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Ohio, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Ohio. Get out and vote. Thank you.\\n Thank you very much, Phoenix. We love to be back. We\\'ll be back a lot. We\\'re going to win that election. Thank you very much. Hello, Phoenix. It\\'s great being here in the great state of Arizona with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And with your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats and we are going to win Arizona in a landslide. It\\'s all over TV that the folks here tonight have helped a great World War II veteran into the arena. I don\\'t know if he knows it, but he\\'s right now the hottest celebrity in the world. I don\\'t know what\\'s going on here. He might even be hotter than Trump right now, I have to say. Did you see the scene? No, he\\'s all over television. Even fake news CNN him on. They say he\\'s a legitimate great hero of World War II. Erwin Julian. Irvin, thank you. And I asked my son Don to get a couple of hats and get some things, and give them to Erwin right now. And I want to thank you. Really, that\\'s a great honor. And thank you for the great job you\\'ve done. An American Patriot. Thank you very much. Thank you, Don. How did Don do tonight? Okay? He\\'s good. Good guy. And he loves this country. So this is truly an incredible time for America. We have the best economy, the most prosperous country that we\\'ve ever had, and the most powerful military anywhere in the world by far. Do you remember the good time we had a week ago at the State of the Union? You remember that, right? And that was my honor. But I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before. And after three years, of very unfair and ridiculous witch hunts and partisan Democrat crusades… It was the radical left\\'s pathetic attempts to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy, and overthrow our entire system of government. But guess what? They failed, and our poll numbers are higher today than they\\'ve ever been before. And we\\'re standing up to the defense of our Constitution, our freedom and democracy itself. We\\'re doing something that\\'s never been done in the history of our country. This movement has never taken place. Nothing like it ever. And the fake news can attest to it, because if they thought I was saying the wrong thing, it\\'d be out there immediately. It\\'d be all over the place. It\\'d be all over the place. Trump exaggerates. That\\'s terrible what he says. There has never been a movement like this, and it began very early. It began in 2016 with that wonderful, beautiful night. You remember that, right? That beautiful night in November. And we\\'re going to have another beautiful night in November. This time, it\\'s going to be November 3rd. Get ready, November 3rd. We\\'re coming. We\\'re coming. So we\\'re having great polls. You\\'re seeing the polls, except for some of the fake ones. And if I was treated fairly… Meaning, if you were treated fairly by the fake news, we\\'d be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldn\\'t even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, it\\'s probably going to be competitive. But I actually think we\\'re going to win by a lot, just like we did last time. But I really believe we\\'d be up 20 points. I mean, all they do is negative, negative, phony stuff. Russia, Russia, Russia. The impeachment hoax. That\\'s a hoax. But you know, we had great support from the Republican party in the House. It was 197 to nothing. And in the Senate, it was 52 and-a-half to a half. You know what the half was? A halfwit. And while the extreme left has been wasting America\\'s time with the hoaxes, we\\'ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion and creed. By the way, they turned away 21,000 people outside, so feel very good. Feel very good. We haven\\'t had an empty seat. You know what? We haven\\'t had… True. We haven\\'t had an empty seat, and this is a tribute to all of us because this is a movement like nobody\\'s ever seen. But we haven\\'t had an empty seat since your great… and this is a great first lady. Came down the escalator with me in Trump Tower a long time ago. We haven\\'t had an empty seat. From our rural communities to our inner cities, we\\'re expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. You saw that, the geniuses. You saw that. You saw that last month. They were doing predictions on one of the shows. What do you think? Well, I think 60,000. What do you think? I think 100,000. What do you think? I think 84,000. These are the ones that tell you all about how to invest. What do you think? And then they came out 225,000, the market goes up again. 225,000. 225,000. So many manufacturing jobs. So many that frankly, we\\'re never going to come back. Remember, you need a magic wand, right? They came back. And remember this, we\\'re paying interest. The past administration didn\\'t pay interest. They pumped money in like it was candy. And we didn\\'t pump money in, we took money out. And not that I was happy about that, because I disagree with it. Because frankly, if we kept the old practice which frankly, some people could dispute one way or the other, we would have been up in my opinion, another 10,000 points in the Dow. And we\\'ve set 144 records on the stock market in three years, 144 records. 144 records. Record stock market. And you know what that means? That your 401Ks are up 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. Guys come up to me. He said, \"Mr. President, I just want to thank you. My wife used to look at me like I was a total loser, sir. Every year we lost money for years and years. She said what the hell is wrong with you, Henry? And this year sir, I\\'m up 92%. She loves to me again. She thinks I\\'m a genius.\" 92% 401K. \"She thinks I\\'m a genius, sir. She loves me again.\" Shows what money can do, right? But that makes… And think of this. Seven million new jobs since we were elected, we were elected. And when I took over, ISIS was all over the place. And we immediately started. We have destroyed 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We have killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi is dead. And we just took out the world\\'s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. And the fake news doesn\\'t want to tell you that. They don\\'t want to tell you that. They don\\'t want to tell you. In fact, do you remember the dog? Great dog, Conan. When we took out, right? We love Conan. Conan\\'s a tough dog. But when we took out al-Baghdadi, Conan… Remember this? Conan got more publicity than President Trump. That\\'s okay. They were looking for al-Baghdadi for 16 years. We found him and we took him out. We killed another one last week. The head of Al-Qaeda. He was gone, dead. And America is respected again, respected like never before. We\\'re respected again. We\\'re no longer the laughingstock that gets taken advantage by every country, including by the way, our allies, who in many cases take a bigger advantage than our enemies. I will tell you that. They take big advantage, but not so much anymore. We\\'re winning. We\\'re winning like never before. Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They hate the fact that we\\'re winning. We\\'re winning big. We\\'re winning, winning, winning. And that is why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. They\\'re joining our great Republican party in droves. You see it all the time. I just spoke to some of your leaders. He said, \"This is unbelievable what\\'s happening. This is unbelievable.\" You know, there have never been rallies like that. Sleepy Joe Biden the other day had 68 people. And now they have a new member of the crew, mini Mike. Mini Mike. No boxes, we call him no boxes. And I hear he\\'s getting pounded tonight. You know, he\\'s in a debate. I hear they\\'re pounding him. He spent $500 million so far, and I think he has 15 points. It just came out. Hey fake news, how many points does he have right now, 15? They won\\'t tell you the truth. They won\\'t tell you the truth. MSDNC, MSDNC is worse than CNN. They\\'re owned by a company called Comcast. You can have Comcast, a bunch of phonies. But MSDNC is worse than CNN, and they\\'re all pretty bad. You know, they just came out with a poll. They just came out with a poll a little while ago. Mini Mike was at 15, and crazy Bernie was at 31. That\\'s a lot. And mini Mike just spent $500 million. But the DNC is going to take it away from Bernie again. That\\'s okay, because we don\\'t care who the hell it is. We\\'re going to win. We\\'re going to win. We have to. Well let me tell you, these crooked politicians, they really took away three years from us. Because despite the fact and nobody disputes it, that we\\'ve done more in three years with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and the military and the choice and everything, we\\'ve done more than any administration in history. We\\'ve done more. But think of it, think of it. We did it with phony witch hunts. We did it with the impeachment hoax over our head the whole time. We did it under circumstances that should never ever happened to another President again. True. But with your energy and enthusiasm this November, we\\'re going to take back the House, we\\'re going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we\\'re thrilled to be joined tonight by some of the best, greatest. I love them. Leaders in America, Arizona leaders. I want to start. Come on up here, Governor Doug Ducey. Come on up here, Doug. Come on up here. You\\'re going to speak in a second. Also, I call them warriors because they fought like hell. They worked with our future Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. But we have some of your great warriors. Paul Gosar, come up here, Paul. Come up here. Andy Biggs. Andy Biggs, head of the Freedom Caucus. Andy Biggs. David Schweikert. David, come up here. A big, big star. You know about that, Doug. She became this monster star. She looked with such indignation at the other side, such disgust, Debbie Lesko. He\\'ll be running some day. You said your grandson? Wow. He\\'ll be running someday. Arizona Senate President, you know who that is, right? Karen Fann. Come up, Karen. Arizona House Speaker, Rusty Bowers. Vice President of the Navajo nation, Myron Lizer. And Arizona Republican party State Chair, Kelly Ward. Kelly Ward, come up. And we have a lot of other leaders, but we\\'ve got to get back to speaking. Do me a favor before I introduce a very special guest, I\\'d like to ask your great Governor… You know, he won like by 16 points. It wasn\\'t even a contest. You know, I\\'m very competitive. I want to beat him. Will you please get out to the polls so we can beat him? But he\\'s tough to beat. Doug Ducey, say a couple of words, please. Please. These are great people, great people. Thank you very much. So you know, before I introduce somebody very important to all of us, to me… Also, I have to say with us tonight is an Arizona hockey great, a friend of mine. He\\'s a great golfer too. He\\'s a tough golfer. I\\'ll tell you, he\\'s tough to beat. He\\'s tough as hell. And if you beat him in golf, he\\'ll try and beat you physically. He doesn\\'t care. He was the toughest hockey player. He was one of these guys, he could beat you one way and if he couldn\\'t, he just beat them up, right? He\\'d beat him up. And he\\'s a friend of mine. He\\'s a great guy, Jeremy Roenik. Where\\'s Jeremy? Where is he? Thank you, Jeremy. He\\'s a winner. We\\'re also joined by Donald, Jr. and Kimberly. They\\'re great people, great. And RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. And RNC finance chairman, also happens on a team called the Chicago Cubs, I shouldn\\'t tell you that… Todd Ricketts. So finally, it\\'s my great honor to introduce a tremendous person, a great fighter pilot. A lot of people don\\'t know that. She\\'s a great fighter pilot and a warrior Senate. She helped us so much during the impeachment hoax, she didn\\'t wobble one bit, Martha McSally. You know, Martha\\'s tough on the border. And she\\'s working with me to strengthen our military still further, and lower your prescription drug prices. We\\'re making a lot of progress. But her opponent, I have to say this Martha, a guy named Mark Kelly. Even the Democrats don\\'t like him much. He wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, give away free healthcare to illegal immigrants, and he wants to obliterate your second amendment. He wants to get rid of it. The radical liberal Democrats from California and Massachusetts, they\\'re pouring money into Kelly\\'s campaign, because they know that he\\'s a rubber stamp for crying Chuck Schumer, crying Chuck, and nervous Nancy wacko Pelosi. And we\\'re going to have a new Speaker. But that\\'s why Martha has my complete and total support and endorsement, and we have to all get out there and make sure that Martha McSally… She\\'s a warrior. Let me tell you, you don\\'t know. We don\\'t know. People don\\'t know, people. This one is tough as hell, and that\\'s what we need. Martha McSally. Thank you. We\\'ll be back. Thank you Martha. Well, she\\'s right. How about that Congressman Al Green? We can\\'t beat him, so we have to impeach him. How about that? That\\'s not what our… as they call them, the founders. How many times did you hear the name, the founders? That\\'s not what the founders had in mind. But we\\'re going to have a big, big election victory. We\\'re working to- But we\\'re going to have a big, big election victory. We\\'re working together. I don\\'t think the Republican party has ever been more unified than it is right now. I really don\\'t believe so. So whatever you can do for Martha, we need her. It\\'s been so incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you for everything, Martha. I appreciate it. Thank you. Together we\\'re building the world\\'s most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere. We\\'re inclusive. This is the Republican party. We\\'re inclusive. Right here in… Right? You know that. Right here in America, right here in Arizona, we\\'ve created 240,000 new jobs right here. Including over 60,000 new manufacturing and construction jobs here. Nobody thought it was possible. You\\'ve had the best year that you\\'ve ever had. Arizona, you\\'ve had the best year, the most successful year that you\\'ve ever had in the history of the country. It\\'s the best year you\\'ve ever had. So I\\'m going to take all the credit away from your governor. I don\\'t care. No, we have a great team with Doug and everybody else, but you\\'ve had the greatest year. You know that, Doug, number one year in the history of your state. It\\'s an incredible achievement. Incredible achievement. I don\\'t know, this has to be pretty good stuff on the debate stage. We\\'ll talk about, \"Well, you had the best… In many states, the best year they\\'ve ever had.\" Then they said, \"Let\\'s get a new president.\" I don\\'t think that\\'s going to work so easily. The country\\'s had the best year it\\'s ever had. Let\\'s get a new president. Let\\'s put in crazy Bernie. Let\\'s go. Crazy Bernie. Unemployment has reached its slowest rate in over 51 years, half a century. The average unemployment rate for my administration… Think of this. The average, so we\\'re talking about now more than three years, is the lowest for any US president in recorded history. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, lowest in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low in the history of our country. African American and Hispanic American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in 71 years. Soon to be historic. And veterans\\' unemployment has dropped to a record low. We\\'re working with our veterans, we\\'re taking care of our veterans like nobody\\'s ever taken care of our veterans. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached the lowest level in history. Workers without a high school diploma, you have a lot of them. They left high school. They said, \"I should have finished.\" They left. They can\\'t go back. They left. We\\'ve achieved the lowest unemployment rate without a diploma ever recorded in US history. Isn\\'t that great? They\\'re great numbers. Hispanic Americans right now, more than 500,000 own a home. More than 500,000 more own a home. And we\\'ve lifted 10 million people off of the welfare rolls. Think of that. 10 million people have come off of the welfare rolls. And happily. Not that we did anything. They have jobs and they love them. They\\'re making much more money and they love getting up and going for work. If they don\\'t like that job, they can get another one, because people are starving to get great employees right now. They\\'re starving to get great employees. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Median income. Think of this. This is such a big deal. Median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country. Under President Bush, in eight years it went to $450 more. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, under a period of eight years, it went to $975. Under president Donald J. Trump… Did you ever hear of him? In only three years, including regulation cuts and tax cuts… Because the other ones raise taxes. We cut taxes by the record amount. It went to $10, 000 per family. A record. A record. That\\'s why our consumer right now, our people, they\\'re booming with cash. That\\'s one of the reasons our economy is doing so much better. China had the worst year in the last 67 years. Asia\\'s doing poorly. Europe is doing poorly. The United States is doing great. We\\'re doing the best we\\'ve ever done. The best we\\'ve ever done. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment, and these are really communities that need it the most, we created Opportunity Zones. We worked with Tim Scott, the great senator from South Carolina. His idea. He came in and saw me. I said, \"Let\\'s give it a shot.\" Nothing\\'s worked over the years, but this has really worked. Now jobs and investment are now pouring into 168 newly designated Opportunity Zones right here in Arizona alone. From Apache to Navajo and Maricopa Counties. We\\'re supporting working families by fighting pay. We are doing a job with paid family leave. We\\'re doing something that nobody\\'s ever done to this extent. Reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pocket thanks to the Republican child tax credit. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is restoring American liberty and cutting through job, killing red tape like nobody has ever cut regulations before. We\\'ve ended the war on American energy, lowering utility bills, reducing prices at the pump, and eliminating our reliance on hostile foreign suppliers. For the first time, America is now energy independent. Such beautiful words. Energy independent. We fought wars. We did everything we could. We used to take the straits and everybody else benefited. We\\'d them clear so that other countries could take oil from the Middle East with… That nobody paid us. Now they\\'re starting to pay us a lot of money, folks. They took advantage of us. But we have everything we need right now. We have made such progress in the last three years with pipelines. The Keystone Pipeline, Keystone XL. I approved it. The Dakota Access Pipeline. I approved it. 48,000 jobs. We\\'re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. The worst trade deals any human being has ever seen. I said, \"Who made these deals?\" The worst, stupidest deals I\\'ve ever seen. They were good for other nations. If you like other nations, that\\'s great. But we\\'re now putting America first. It\\'s very simple. For years, Washington politicians took money from lobbyists, global corporations, and really, the most corrupt special interests anybody\\'s ever seen. To ship our jobs and our factories to other countries. We lost our taxes, we lost our workers, we lost our companies, and we did nothing about it. Now we\\'ve done a lot about it because companies are pouring back in. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA, the worst deal ever made, worst trade deal ever made, and one that was almost as bad and gave China an entrance into being a rocket ship when they entered the World Trade, WTO. One of the worst deals that we participated in this. By the way, we just won $7.5 billion in a lawsuit with WTO. We weren\\'t winning anything. We weren\\'t winning anything, but they said, \"I think this guy\\'s going to pull out.\" They treated us so unfairly. We were always in the minority position. I mean, who the hell negotiated these deals? But they look at us and they say, \"Look, if we\\'re not treated fairly, we\\'re gone.\" All of a sudden, we\\'re winning all these cases. But we just won 7.5 billion. 7.5 billion. Did you know that, Doug? 7.5 billion. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America\\'s no longer for sale. America is no longer for sale. Those days are over. Two generations of politicians came and went promising to replace NAFTA. How many times have you heard we\\'re going to replace NAFTA? Probably the number one reason I ran for office. Are we glad I ran for office? I think so. It\\'s funny, I was watching the different… I find it fascinating. I\\'m watching the different returns coming in and I\\'m watching as much as I can of this stuff. I love it. We all love it. If you don\\'t love it, you\\'re not going to do it very well. The crazy New York Times, which was a dead newspaper when I ran, it was dead as a doornail. A month before I ran, Doug, I held up a New York Times, it was like what you get thrown in your face at a supermarket. It was a thing. It just flew away. There was nothing. Now it\\'s doing very well. But you know what? Someday we won\\'t be here. When we\\'re not, those papers are in big trouble. But this thing was a dead newspaper. But I was watching and they had an article this weekend about people that spent their own money and how they\\'re doing. They have Mini Mike has spent $411 million. It\\'s a question mark, how\\'s he going to… I\\'ll tell you how he\\'s going to do. He\\'s probably not going to get the democratic nomination. That\\'s how he\\'s going to do. But Mini Mike, $411. Then they had this idiot, Steyer. We call him impeachment Steyer. How did that work out, Steyer? He\\'s another beauty. The guy worked… He spent 210 million. He got one-third of 1% in Iowa. In New Hampshire he did much better. He got less than 3%. Guy\\'s in there for like 250 million. How did it work out, Steyer? You jerk. I never even heard of him. I never even heard of him. I turn on every time… For years, I\\'m turning on… Impeach him. They don\\'t even know why. They never say why. They don\\'t have any reason. Impeach the president. This guy spent a fortune on this stuff, so it worked out pretty good. But anyway, so then I go and I look. It has Mini Mike\\'s… Question marks. I can give you the answer, but right now they have to have a question mark, right? Then they go down and they had other people. Some of them I like. They have Ross Perot, who honestly… It was a tough day for Bush when he joined the campaign. Because Clinton didn\\'t win. Ross Perot took away 19% of the votes. Didn\\'t Clinton get 41 or 43%? Give me a break. But that\\'s okay. Whatever. But they had Ross Perot spent like 100 million, which is probably double if you bring it up to today\\'s dollars. Then they have different people. A friend of mine who ran, Steve Forbes, he ran twice. He was in for a lot. Then they had Donald Trump. Now, this is your own money. This is your own money. I said I\\'d spend a lot of money on my primaries. We\\'ll see how the hell we do. It\\'s amazing. Once you win, money comes in. It comes in pretty fast. What\\'s that all about? But so in the middle they had Trump, and then they had four or five that were behind me. Lot of money spent. Loss, loss, loss, loss, loss. But in the middle they have Donald Trump. It didn\\'t say 500 million, and it didn\\'t say 250 like this Steyer guy. It didn\\'t say… It said 70 million of my own money. I spent 70. It said, \"Donald Trump won the presidency of the United States.\" Right? We won. My father would teach me, if you could spend less and win, that\\'s better than spending a lot and winning. Crooked Hillary spent at least three times more than we did and lost. Crooked as hell. She\\'s crooked as hell. We have a double-sided justice. It\\'s very unfair what\\'s going on. Very unfair. But let\\'s see how it all works out, folks. Let\\'s see how it all works out. I hope you\\'re going to be happy. I hope you\\'re going to be happy, because there are a lot of dishonest slimeballs out there. Dishonest scum. Dirty cops, a lot of dirty cops. By the way, the FBI, those guys in that are incredible. But the ones on top, they were absolute scum. What they were trying to do, if that happened to Obama, or a Democrat, or especially a liberal Democrat, they\\'d be in jail for 50 years and it would have taken place two years ago already. They spied on our campaign. Remember that. After they spied, we won. Then after we won, they tried to get us out of office. It\\'s never happened before in the history of our country, and we can\\'t let that happen. We can never ever excuse it. We can never let them get away with that. Never let them get away with it. But we keep our promises that we work hard and our economy is great. The last month, we ended the NAFTA… Look, you saw it. NAFTA catastrophe. That\\'s what it was. We ended that catastrophe. Again, I really ran because of NAFTA. I said, \"How stupid.\" All over the place. In your state, but you go to New England, empty factories, empty buildings. Still you have empty buildings. We lost so much. We lost 60,000 factories and plants. I signed that brand new, beautiful US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, and ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Arizona. By the way, for people with the small farms and small businesses, if you love your children, you can now leave your companies, you can leave your farm, you can leave your ranch to your children, and you don\\'t have to to pay, they don\\'t pay a death tax. They don\\'t pay an inheritance tax. A big deal. That\\'s a big deal. So if you love your children, it\\'s good. If you don\\'t love your children, it doesn\\'t matter. Don\\'t leave it to them, if you don\\'t love. If your children are no good to you, don\\'t give them anything. Let them go out and work like hell. No, if you love… Does anybody in this incredible audience… Man, this is a big building. Does anybody not love their children? Anybody? Do I have a hand? Do I have a… There\\'s a hand. You\\'ve got to be kidding. You\\'ve got to be kidding. So then you don\\'t care about the tax. Okay, don\\'t worry about it. He says, \"No, I don\\'t care about that one.\" Well, that\\'s good. You look like a nice guy too. He\\'s tough. You\\'d love to be his kid, wouldn\\'t you? But I also took the strongest ever action to confront China\\'s massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Last month, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports. China will invest $250 billion a year into the United States and buy our products and create jobs. Nothing like that has ever happened before. After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. That\\'s the way we want it. We are finally putting our country first. We are putting America first. On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than immigration. You know it almost better than anybody. Anybody, Doug. You know it better than anybody, what they\\'ve done on your border, but we\\'re stopping that border. That border is clogged, and we\\'ve started the big wall right in Arizona. We build a lot of wall. That\\'s a big one. That\\'s a big one. Top of the line. Before I came into office, the far left\\'s policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country, poisoning our children. Including, as you know very well right here in Arizona, Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone from around the world simply walk across the border. Then they want to give them a lifetime of free welfare, healthcare, everything. They want to give them everything. For a long period of time, they were treated… You know this before I came. They were treated far better than our veterans were treated. Now our veterans are treated great. True. Illegal immigration costs Arizona taxpayers more than $2 billion every year. Two billion you\\'re paying. Nearly 20% of Arizona\\'s annual budget in general funds goes toward this big problem. For the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild our cities all throughout America, which is what we should be doing. Under my administration, we are finally taking care of our own citizens, including millions and millions of legal immigrants who follow our laws, pay their taxes, and are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities. Every day, Democrats\\' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives. In Arizona alone last year, ICE officers arrested over 4,500 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Right here in Phoenix, an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he laid dying in the street. This savage animal had previously been deported after serving six years in prison. He was in prison six years. He was there six years and nobody wants to talk about it. They want to protect them. Last year in Tucson, another illegal alien was sentenced to 10 years for repeatedly raping a vulnerable young woman. Yet left wing politicians oppose all detention of illegal aliens, even convicted criminals, and they support deadly sanctuary cities that release these criminal aliens directly into America\\'s communities. Thankfully, Arizona has banned sanctuary cities. With a Republican majority in Congress, we will ban them in every state in America. 30 in the morning. I then went to California, made two speeches. I then went someplace else. I said, \"Am I finished?\" No, you\\'ve got to go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25,000 people. I said, \"That\\'s okay. That\\'s okay.\" I said, \"That\\'s okay.\" No, I said, \"That\\'s okay,\" because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd. But you know what? Honestly, there\\'s tremendous energy in our nation. There\\'s tremendous energy in our nation. Greatest nation in the world. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row, which will soon be a record. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring. The month of January saw the fewest illegal border crossings in two years. And we\\'ve ended catch and release, a horrible Democrat policy that we got terminated. Border patrol, great people, have seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever recorded in the history of our country this year. We\\'ve deported record numbers of gang members, including the worst gang of all, MS-13. Thousands and thousands of people have been thrown the hell out of our country. We\\'ve done more to secure the border than any administration in history. We\\'re building the wall, as I said, faster than ever. It will soon be almost one new mile a day. We\\'re looking for that. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme, taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders. How\\'s he doing tonight? 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie\\'s healthcare takeover of the world. Think of this, 180 million Americans are going to lose healthcare coverage under this plan. But if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m not going to criticize it tonight. Let them keep going and I\\'ll start talking about it about two weeks out from the election. Okay? Because I don\\'t want him to change. Please don\\'t change. Same with the Green New Deal. I don\\'t want to talk about it, Doug, tonight. I don\\'t want to talk about it. I came up with the name Pocahontas. Too early. But fortunately, she\\'s self-destructed anyway. Did you ever see a phony like that? She\\'s a phony. She lost because she couldn\\'t keep it straight on her own heritage. She said she was an Indian. I said, \" I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none.\" She said, \"Oh,\" and she panicked. She panicked, and she had a test. You know the result, 1/124th. I think I win the bet. Somewhere along the line, I think I win. No, she… I did it too early. I would have saved it, but I guess it was effective. She\\'s essentially gone-zo, so… One of those things. While the socialist Democrats are try- … one of those things. While the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare and your social security, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. And that\\'s what we\\'re getting. That\\'s right. One of the big secrets. The Democrats won\\'t let us say it. They want to keep that as quiet as possible. Look what they gave you, the worst healthcare. And what we\\'ve done, we\\'ve gotten rid of things that nobody could believe that was so bad for you. Everybody was happy with defending your right to keep your doctor and plan of your choice. We\\'re making healthcare better and much, much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office, we are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive than they were, and it\\'s better healthcare. A lot of people don\\'t know this. People don\\'t know this. They think that\\'s their issue. It\\'s not. They failed on healthcare. We\\'re protecting people with preexisting conditions, and we always will. And by the way, we\\'re trying to get rid of Obamacare, but we\\'re managing it incredibly, but we\\'re trying to get rid so we can give you a great healthcare plan and protect preexisting conditions. Remember that. We\\'re trying to get rid of it, but while we\\'re having it, we\\'re managing it really much better than they did. Remember they built the $5 billion website? Remember that? It was supposed to cost $5 million. It cost $5 billion. $5 billion. I mean, you could get a kid out of high school. I have a son. He\\'s a young boy, 13. He uses a computer. He could have given them a healthcare site. I would say he would have charged them $100, Barron Trump, and it would\\'ve worked. He\\'s so good. \"Hi dad. How you doing, dad? How\\'s it going?\" Bing, bing, bong. I said, \"Don\\'t play with that while you\\'re talking to me.\" \"What\\'s going on, dad?\" These kids are incredible, right? The kids, they make us look like babies with that. But he could have given you a great site for about $2. They spent $5 billion on a site that never worked. By the way, speaking of that, how did they do with their vote count in Iowa? And I hear, I hear, I don\\'t want to say it. I don\\'t want to jinx them because, of course, I want them to do well, but I do. We don\\'t have anything. Nobody\\'s running against us in so many states. It\\'s sort of nice. We can save the thunder, right? But I hear that in Nevada. I\\'m hearing bad things about their vote count. I hear a lot of bad things are happening, like they don\\'t know what the hell they\\'re doing. I turned on the other night, Iowa, I wanted to see … And by the way, we set a record in the history of Iowa. We had more votes than anybody\\'s ever had as an incumbent president. Same thing in New Hampshire. It\\'s a good sign. It\\'s a good sign. By a lot. By the way, by a lot. But I\\'m hearing that, and I hope this isn\\'t the case because I\\'d like to find out who the hell won. We still don\\'t know who won in Iowa. I heard coming over here they\\'re still working on the count. No, no, no. He said, \"You won.\" Yeah, I think we did win. I think we did. Very good. That\\'s very good. I have to thank you, that one. That\\'s very good. No, we did win. Look, we are winning. We\\'re winning big. We have fake polls out there. These guys do fake polls. They are fake polls. I had a poll. It\\'s just like it was in 2016. I\\'d hear these polls. I\\'d hear women didn\\'t like me, and I did great with women. I hear everyone didn\\'t like me. Nobody liked me. Nobody liked me. And then we won. Thank you, women. Nobody liked me 2016. No, no, I hear that. Remember, women didn\\'t like him, and at the end of that he did great with women. He did great with this. He did great with everybody. We did great with everybody. Remember, 306 to 223. That\\'s a slaughter. That\\'s a slaughter. Remember, they said he cannot get, they used the word path. There is no path, right, to 270? I was at 269 if I did great, but they said there\\'s no chance. But I was at 269, so I went to Maine. I love Maine. I went to Maine. Maine\\'s cut in half. And one Maine has one. I went there four or five times. People are great. I won it. And they were right. There is no path to 270, but there was a path to 306. These people. These people. There is no path. That\\'s right, Doug. They said there is no path, the fake news media. \"There is no path for Donald Trump.\" And then they said the evening of the election, \"It\\'s going to be a really short night for Donald Trump. Thank God, we got rid of this guy.\" Because they did the exit polls going out, right? And I was even told, but a lot of people didn\\'t want to talk about it. The highest number in history of people that said very nasty language, but I\\'m not going to use that name because you\\'ll kill me if I use it. So I won\\'t use it. It\\'s a much better story if I use it because that\\'s the truth. That\\'s what they said. \"How did you vote?\" Usually, they say, \"I voted for Clinton,\" or, \"I voted for Trump.\" Right? \"How\\'d you vote?\" \"None of your business.\" See, I\\'m being nice, right? I\\'ll keep it that way because otherwise we\\'ll ruin the whole evening. They\\'ll say, \"His language,\" right? Even this tough guy in the front says, \"I agree.\" \"How did you vote?\" \"No, I don\\'t want to tell you.\" \"How did you vote?\" \"None of your damn business. I\\'m not going to tell you.\" \"How did you vote?\" \"I\\'m not … \" And it was like this massive number, right? Massive. So everybody, they just didn\\'t count that. So they said numbers are looking unbelievably well for crooked Hillary Clinton. They\\'re looking unbelievable. This is going to be a very short evening for Donald Trump. We finally will be rid of this guy. And then the numbers started coming in. The numbers started coming in, and it started with the great state of Florida. Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. And then that beautiful convention center, the most beautiful stage I\\'ve ever seen. And they knew something was going on because they didn\\'t pay the final payment for the fireworks two weeks before. Right? In fact, I went to the fireworks company, and I said, \"I\\'ll give you five cents on the dollar for your fireworks,\" even though they were no way near where my area was. We were at a hotel in Midtown. We liked the location better than where she chose, but they built the most … we remember that beautiful stage. It was shaped like the United States of America. And by the end, it didn\\'t look too good. Did you ever see more unhappy people? So they go, \"Donald Trump has won the great state of Florida. They go, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa.\" They outspent me like five to one. Only negative ads. They\\'re all negative. So by the time people got into the voters booth, they only knew one thing. She hated Donald Trump, but they said, \"What the hell does she stand for? What does she do?\" Every ad was a negative ad. So it tells you negative ads, at least against me, aren\\'t so good. They can be effective. But I think they spent like $ 2 billion on negative ads. Everything was negative. So nobody knew what the hell she spent. You know, her husband said she was going to lose. Her husband\\'s a professional. Her husband said, \"You better go to Michigan because I was there and they got a Trump/Pence sign on every lawn I\\'ve ever seen. You better go to Wisconsin, Hillary. You better go to Wisconsin.\" She said, \"No, we haven\\'t lost Wisconsin in 36 years\". \"No, no, Hillary, you got to go there. I\\'m telling you, I don\\'t like what I saw.\" \"No, what do you know?\" He\\'s a professional politician. She wasn\\'t. It\\'s one of those little problems in life. So then it came in, and then we won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. Right? And we were leading Pennsylvania by so much that if I lost, remember at 2% of the vote left, if I lost every single vote, I win by a lot. They refused, the fake news refused to call it. I kept saying, \"We won Pennsylvania. Why don\\'t they call it?\" It was very late in the evening when they called it because they are fake, they\\'re crooked. They are fake. And I said, \"Why don\\'t they call Pennsylvania?\" But some beautiful things happened. And by the way, Ohio, we won by one of the largest margins ever. The great, great, great state of Ohio. Remember? Remember, they used to say a year before the election, they said, \"Well, nobody can win. Nobody, unless you win the great state of Ohio.\" And we won the great state of Ohio, and we won it big. We knew we were going to win it. And now we\\'re up a lot more than we were up even then, because you know why? We\\'re bringing back jobs. We\\'re bringing back factories. Everybody\\'s working. Nobody\\'s ever had a better year than we\\'ve been having. And we\\'ve been doing it for a long time, right? Almost from the beginning. And don\\'t let them try and take credit, because if they came in, we would have ended up in a massive recession or worse, the D word, depression. We would have been, because they were going to put more and more and more regulations on. And I\\'ll tell you, maybe bigger than even the tax cuts, and I did it sooner, were the regulation cuts. We freed up our nation to go back to work. True. So then we won Wisconsin, and then we won Michigan because those companies, now they\\'re pouring back in. The auto companies are pouring back in, and Wisconsin\\'s doing great with the farmers that Canada was taking. You know, Canada was charging our farmers 287% tariffs for dairy products. Okay? So what happens is this, we\\'re working on healthcare. We\\'re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I just signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very fast. We\\'ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the brand drugs, but they cost a tiny fraction. We\\'ve totally transformed veteran\\'s healthcare, including getting long-sought VA choice and VA accountability, which they said could not be done. And we passed the spectacular right to try. So if you\\'re in trouble, and I hope nobody in this massive arena\\'s in trouble, but if you\\'re in trouble, you can go and get whatever the new drug or whatever where we have the best doctors, best hospital, best labs. You get it. And the luck we are having, we are saving so many lives. It\\'s incredible what\\'s happening. People would go to Europe. They\\'d go to Asia. If they had no money, they\\'d go home and die. Now they have the right to use our drugs before they\\'re approved. Think of that. Before they\\'re approved. And we\\'re very importantly combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths. The overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 34 years, and life expectancy is rising again in our nation. We\\'ve launched bold new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer\\'s disease. We\\'re making tremendous progress, and we\\'re pursuing new advances in neo-medical research. Think of that, neonatal research, the numbers are incredible. What\\'s happened is incredible, to care for America\\'s youngest patients and breaking all records in doing so. All of the radical Democrats in the presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother\\'s womb right up until the very moment of birth. That is why in my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late-term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total destruction of your Second Amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, the Second Amendment and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We have tremendous energy. Tremendous energy. Everybody says to me, \"Where do you get the energy?\" Because I love what we\\'re doing. I see the results, and they\\'re happening faster than you even think. You see the numbers. They\\'re happening faster than you would even think. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We are the party with big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right? Right? To keep our community safer and give former prisoners a second chance at life. There\\'s been nothing like this. I passed criminal justice reform, not the Democrats. I did it with the Republicans, and this could not have been done by anybody but me and the Republican party. The Democrats did not do it. They could never have done it.  Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, including nearly $200 million for Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. Right? I recognized Israel as the true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. We recognize Israel sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They\\'ve been trying to get it for 52 years. And for years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. You saw that. They apologized. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Arizona. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. It is. This election is so important. It\\'s the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020. You\\'re the forgotten people no more. Right? No deplorables, right? No deplorables. Who knew that was going to turn out to be such a disaster? But you know, she used the worst word. What was the word she used? Irredeemables, right? I thought that was the problem. No, it was deplorable. So what the hell do I know about politics? She said, \"You\\'re irredeemable and deplorable.\" I said, \"Oh, that irredeemable\\'s terrible.\" The next day people are showing up. Women, \"I\\'m a deplorable.\" Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp, which is vicious, horrible, ugly, and evil. Much worse than I thought. But we\\'re getting there and not pleasant. A bunch of really bad people, very dishonest people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words and phrase. I love the phrase, Made in the USA. Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within now nine years. We started a year ago. Can you imagine that? We\\'re doing that, and it\\'s going to happen. Who would have thought we could have done that? We will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars. We will defend privacy, free speech, and you know this. You know it\\'s under siege, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will defend it. It\\'s under siege. It\\'s under siege. You see it in Virginia. They want to take away the guns. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto In God We Trust. From Tucson to Tombstone, right? Do you agree? You agree, right? Look at him. He\\'s agreeing, this guy. He\\'s agreeing. No more censorship is right. No more evil. No more crimes. You\\'re right. From Yuma to Mesa and from Flagstaff to right here in Phoenix, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and to defend our freedom. Arizona was founded by pioneers and prospectors, great prospectors, cowboys and miners and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, braved the blazing sun, and it is hot here. I\\'ve been here during the summer. I want to tell you, it\\'s seriously hot. Of course, didn\\'t they say that President Clinton, when he went on the back of the plane was here to play golf, it was 121 degrees that day? I don\\'t know about that. I don\\'t know about that. What do you think he was doing with the Attorney General? I remember he said, \"Oh, I just happened to see she was … I was here to play golf. It was 120 degrees out.\" I don\\'t know. A lot of crooked stuff went on. I wonder what they talked about. I\\'m sure it wasn\\'t that she would become a Supreme Court Justice. I\\'m sure it wasn\\'t that they were going to extend her tenure as Attorney General. She was a real beauty. I\\'m sure it wasn\\'t. I\\'m sure it was nothing. They spent 45 minutes on the plane talking about golf and their grandchildren. Right? Can\\'t let it happen, folks. Can\\'t let it happen. We can\\'t let it happen. You fought the battles and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the earth, and we are making it greater every single day than ever before. Great, great, great citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, with your help, your devotion and with your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Do you like winning? Because not very long ago you weren\\'t winning, and I don\\'t want you … I told this a few times during the campaign. Haven\\'t used it in a long time, but I don\\'t want you going to your great governor. He\\'s a great governor, Doug Ducey. I don\\'t want you going to your governor saying, \"Governor, governor, we just can\\'t stand winning so much. Please go see the president in the oval office. Governor, the people of Arizona don\\'t want to keep on winning. It\\'s too much governor. It\\'s not even fair to the rest of the planet. Please tell him, Governor Ducey, please tell him, ‘President, the people of Arizona have won too much. We don\\'t want to keep on winning.\\'\" And I\\'ll look at Doug Ducey, and I\\'ll say, \"Doug, I\\'ve a lot of respect for you, Doug. You won by 16 points. That means a lot. But Doug, I don\\'t care what you say. We\\'re going to keep on winning, and we\\'re going to win like never before. And the people of Arizona are going to love it.\" And he\\'s going to say, \"Thank you, Mr. President. I\\'m going back home.\" The fact is, we are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Arizona, the best is yet to come. That\\'s right. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you, Arizona. Thank you. \\nSo thank you Pennsylvania, very much. I\\'m thrilled to be in Latrobe, the home of the late, great, my friend, Arnold Palmer. What a great guy he was. What a great guy. Thank you very much. 61 days from now, we\\'re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in the White House. Joe Biden wants to surrender your jobs to China. You know that. His son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing. He wants to surrender your nation to the radical left wing mob. He\\'s trying to change now. We say that\\'s not working because we\\'re going up and he\\'s dropping like a rock in water. And before the China virus, this election was over. Now I had to go back to work and we\\'ve done a great job on it. We don\\'t get the credit. We don\\'t get the credit. We made a lot of governors look very good. But I will keep your jobs in America, and I\\'ll bring rioters, looters, violent extremists, anarchists, we will bring them to justice. That\\'s what we\\'re doing right now. We have over 400 right now under arrest. These are bad people. Over the last three and a half years, we\\'ve secured America\\'s borders, fixed our broken trade deals, rebuilt the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%, secured American energy independence, and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we\\'re going to do it again. Have to do it again. Have to do it again. Got to do it again. And it\\'s happening. You see what\\'s happening. Job numbers, retail sale numbers, they\\'re all at records. It\\'s happening. It\\'s happening very fast. It\\'s actually happening in a super V, not a V. It\\'s a super V and you\\'ll see that, and big numbers are coming out and have come out, and just watch your set or watch your newspaper. Read your newspaper. You\\'re seeing numbers that, congressmen, we haven\\'t seen those numbers ever before, actually. We\\'ve never seen them. And by the way, we have record stock markets. We have record everything. You\\'re going to have an incredible economic year next year. Your stocks are going up. Your 401s are through the roof. I had a little pause today. People wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way. But the stock market\\'s at record levels. Think of it. In the hopefully rounding the turn on the pandemic, we\\'re rounding that turn, and vaccines are coming along great. The job that they\\'ve done, the doctors, everybody else, we\\'re years ahead of schedule. Anybody else\\'s President, you wouldn\\'t be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now. I\\'ll tell you right now. That I can tell you. Biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family. He is a puppet of the socialists, Marxists, and the cop hating extremists. And they are cop hating. And we love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. And by the way, I don\\'t know if you saw this, if there\\'s any way of you seeing it, we have thousands of people behind this hangar, thousands, and we\\'re trying to get them in. And I\\'d love to get them in. I mean, it\\'s an airport. Let them go to the runways. Okay? Let them in. I mean, literally there, we landed. I actually thought that was the crowd. We\\'re doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can\\'t do it because of the pandemic for a while, a little while. But in certain ways, I like this better. I don\\'t have to travel. I get off the plane. I make a speech. I get the hell out of here. No, these are great. Do you remember the last days before the campaign? I\\'d do a lot of them a day. Get off that plane. It was a little different plane. It was black and white instead of the blue and white. But we had some time. And that was an important day and that was an important year, 2016. But I will tell you, the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country. And we had a level of enthusiasm, I mean, even look today. With all going on, look at the kind of crowds we have. But we had record enthusiasm in 2016. By the way, was that greatest evening ever? November. And now it\\'s going to be November 3rd, and we\\'ll keep it going and we\\'ll get it all like a tree. You move that tree. It takes a little while to plant, your tax cuts. They\\'re going to raise your taxes. They\\'re going to take away your guns. Really, if you look. And you know, they\\'ll criticize me for saying this, the fake news media, which is back there, with their fake polls. The same as last year. We could just put it all on tape. The fake polls, the fake everything. You know, they\\'re called suppression polls. They\\'re meant to make you depressed. Are you depressed? You don\\'t look depressed. We have the real numbers. We\\'re leading everywhere. We are leading everywhere. I\\'ll tell you. I think we\\'re way ahead of what we were four years ago, and there\\'s far more enthusiasm. Our base is bigger. It\\'s stronger. And we\\'ve done the greatest job. Again, if we didn\\'t get hit by the plague from China, between us, I would have canceled, Mr. Congressman, most of the rallies. I wouldn\\'t have needed a rally. That\\'s a little bit unfair, but that\\'s okay. That\\'s what China\\'s done to our nation. They\\'ve screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways. Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China, and I\\'ve taken in billions and billions of dollars. We never took in 25 cents from China. And I gave $28 billion, right, $28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China. And our farmers are very unhappy. I don\\'t think we have too many farmers in this wonderful Pennsylvania town. I know we have a lot of boilermakers over there. We got a lot of boilermakers, I\\'ll be talking about them. Look at those guys. Nobody going to mess with them. I\\'ll tell you. We\\'re going to be talking about them in a minute. But for the entire summer, Biden was silent as far left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in Democrat run cities all, burned down businesses, terrorized civilians, and just recently marched through the streets chanting, \"Death to America.\" This is what we have. Death to America. And by the way, we could end it like immediately. You saw what we did in Wisconsin. It ended. It took a while for the governor. You know, they have to ask us in. It\\'s like, otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it\\'s totally unnecessary. The National Guard is fantastic. I went to see them two days ago. Biden went there today. There was nobody there. There was nobody there. He was a little late. I was going to say, \"Hey, listen, we ended that problem.\" But we could end it in Portland. Wise guys in Portland. Anarchists. They\\'re agitators. They\\'re looters. I\\'ll tell you we could end it in Portland in a half an hour. We did it in Seattle. We told them we\\'re coming in. You either end it or were coming in. Congressman, we were going in the next day. We were all set. I was actually disappointed, to be honest. They ended it in Seattle. They took over 20% of the city. Do you believe this? And the mayor said, \"No, it\\'s going to be a summer of love.\" These people are crazy. So we end them very quickly. We end them very quickly. And now what we\\'re doing is we\\'re holding back funds for cities that don\\'t know what they\\'re doing, where they allow crime to run rampant. And we put a 10 year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue. I took out an old ordinance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you don\\'t get things like that today. They think that you should just have no cash bail. They do the no cash bail. You kill somebody. There\\'s no bail. Don\\'t worry about it. Go out. But I took out an old ordinance. I gave a new executive order. It says 10 years in prison. And amazingly, amazingly, that was three and a half months ago. And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere, and amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down. No statutes. And we\\'re actually prosecuting people for having done it. We made it retroactive to the beginning. Terrible. Terrible. And by the way, the state statues and monuments, they have to do the same thing. It\\'s real easy. But the rioters that want Biden to win, they want him to win because their agenda, it\\'s what they want. It\\'s the craziest thing I\\'ve ever seen. They both want to cut funding for police. They want to end that cash bail. They want to hire far left prosecutors and judges, and let the criminals run wild. The radical left District Attorney in Portland, Mike Schmidt, his name is, has released hundreds of rioters that announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, rioting, and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance. Oh, it\\'s worse. It\\'s worse. You have somebody in Philadelphia who\\'s worse, right? Worse. In his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, that\\'s what it is, Biden agreed to all these things. You notice now, \"No, no. I never said about fracking. I never said.\" If you don\\'t do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple. Other than that, I don\\'t think you should have it. Okay? No, but he said in the manifesto, plus he said many times, we put on the clip yesterday where he, no fracking, no this, no that, I mean, no guns. How about guns? No guns. No second amendment. Biden has pledged to a point prosecutors who extend these insane far left policies nationwide. That\\'s what he\\'s done. That\\'s called the manifesto. He agreed to all this stuff. The craziest thing, you\\'re supposed to bring it to the right. He actually brought it further left. Bernie never dreamt that this was possible, crazy Bernie. Do you know crazy Bernie? I had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago, a big percentage. You know why? Because I agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing, trade. The trade. Because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did I. Nobody else got it. Especially Biden never got it. He never got it. Still doesn\\'t get it. Now he really gets nothing. I tell you. He didn\\'t get it in prime time. Now he really doesn\\'t get it. But it\\'s okay for them to make every city look just like Portland which is a disaster. And again, we could clean it up. We just go right through it. 5,000, 10,000, right through it. These guys are tough. They\\'re smart. And they love our country. They love our country. We\\'ll clean it up in one half hour. It\\'ll be over.  strength. They don\\'t understand. Nice. They chased him out of his home. Unbelievable. Biden\\'s plan is to appease the domestic terrorist. And my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them. And I will always defend law abiding citizens. That\\'s why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people, you know, we have it from everybody. We just got the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, all of them. We got Ohio. We got Texas. We got North Carolina. We got South Carolina. We got everybody. I see Rick Perry right there. Rick Perry, what are you doing here, Rick? Rick Perry, one of the greats. But they\\'re all voting for me. This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. Today, I\\'m delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like. Sort of grew up with these people. I don\\'t know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us. What I\\'m endorsing, I\\'m getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people. They work hard. They do great. We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble. At last year, you had the single greatest economic year in the history of your whole operation, right? Of your whole operation. You\\'ve never had anything like that. This has been your greatest. This has been prior to the plague coming in. It\\'s been the Commonwealth\\'s greatest. Can we ever call the Commonwealth a state? You have two places. But you always have to say, well, wait a minute. Is this one a Commonwealth? Two places. You know what the other place is? Name it. Huh? That\\'s right. How did you know that, Congressmen? Huh? But this Commonwealth, it\\'s a great Commonwealth. It\\'s a great place. And the boilermakers, local union, it\\'s Local 154 of the boilermakers. They chartered in Pittsburgh 125 years ago. None of you were around to see it, and it now represents members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. And I want to thank John Hughes and the boilermakers here today. It\\'s a great honor to have you. Where\\'s John? Where the hell is John? Stand up, John. John, we appreciate it. We appreciate it. Do you know why John is the head? You know why? Because look, he\\'s got the worst location. I say, \"Where\\'s John?\" I\\'m looking in the front row. Put up your hand, John. Look at that guy. He\\'s great. You\\'ve got my vote, John. Hey, boilermakers, thank you. What a job you do. You\\'re the heart of this country. You really are. Thank you very much. That\\'s a great endorsement. That\\'s a great endorsement. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations. And I\\'ve spent the last four years bringing them back home and we\\'re bringing them back home. Bringing a lot of things back home. I ended the last administration\\'s eight year pure war on Pennsylvania oil, and coal, and fracking. If you look at the natural gas, what they\\'ve done to this state, what they were doing to this state. It was sort of easy. I just opened it up and I said, \"Do it.\" And the investment put into Pennsylvania, the investment put into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been record setting. But again, you had the greatest year you\\'ve ever had last year prior to the virus. You\\'re going to be set. Now with what we\\'re doing, I believe that this next quarter, which will be announced, interestingly, just prior to the election, so I\\'m putting myself on the line, but I know what\\'s going to happen. The numbers are going to be great. And next year is going to be one of the greatest years not only for Pennsylvania, but for the entire country. So Joe Hiden, we have a new one, Joe Hiden. We call him Joe Hiden. I have all. What do you like better? What do you like better? We got a number. Let\\'s do a little poll. Can we do a poll? I saved myself so much money. You know, I saved myself so much money. We do these polls with thousands, and those people are coming in from the back, are they not? Yes? They\\'re coming in. I\\'m telling you wouldn\\'t have believed it. I\\'m landing. I wasn\\'t waving at you. I was waving at them. There\\'s more. But I do these polls. Right? And it\\'s like a perfect poll. Do you ever see the companies? You give them a million bucks and they do a poll, like 78 people were polled. Now you\\'ve got thousands of people. So tell me. What\\'s your feeling, first of all in the name You like MAGA, Make America Great Again? Yes? Oh, you are the one. You are a man. I made you famous today. You said the nicest things about me. Thank you. Did you see him on television today? I think you\\'re great. I think you\\'re great. Thank you. No, he called me a great Christian and a great Christian leader. Thank you. But he did say I wasn\\'t perfect, but that\\'s okay. I said thank you, anyway. Right? No, that was really great. That was really great. Biden- No that was really great. That was really great. But if you look at it, the things they\\'ve done, we\\'re going to go through a couple of different polls as we go along because I love the people saying do this or do that. But one of the things I got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it\\'s so bad. It\\'s a rip off of our country. The so-called Paris Climate Accord. It\\'s a disaster, a death sentence. It\\'s a death sentence for your energy jobs. I took it out. I withdrew from that calamity. Biden pledged to reinstate it. It\\'s going to cost you billions and billions of dollars. You know what it really is? It\\'s a way of really taking advantage of the United States. This is what it is. Last year I visited the Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County. Anybody ever hear of Beaver County? The largest investment in your state\\'s history, all made possible by our pro-energy policies. Biden would wipe out that entire industry killing the jobs of more than 600,000 Pennsylvania workers. It\\'s probably 940,000 they say. Think of that. Also, prices and everything else. Now Biden today came out and said, \"No, no, fracking\\'s okay, it\\'s okay? Did you see that? Fracking\\'s okay. Because he was getting killed. And now we came out in favor of law enforcement. Look at all these handsome cops here. And a beautiful cop. If you would see how beautiful, if you would see how beautiful this is, it was like this perfect evening, the sun was setting, the faces of these great, great majestic heroes of our country, right? Heroes of our country. And they want to blow Mount Rushmore. But how about this one? The Democrats yesterday came out with a plan. Did you see it? Now, they\\'re the DC Democrats. They want to change the name of the Washington Monument, perhaps take it down. Thomas Jefferson, pretty good Thomas Jefferson, right? You could forget about ever hearing that name again. Abraham Lincoln, you could forget about it. They want to take down all statues, all monuments in Washington. We have some of your greatest people right here. Let me not even talk to the congressmen. The heck with the Congressman, the boiler makers. How do you like? How do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, all of them? I don\\'t think the boiler makers. You\\'ll do a ring around Washington right? Along with Christopher Columbus. He\\'s in big trouble I\\'ll tell you. Except there was one, there was a group of great Italians in New York, they tried to take down. They tried to take down Christopher Columbus statue in New York. You saw what happened, right? These Italians formed a little circle. They said, \"Come on.\" The agitators decided to leave. \"Let\\'s get out of here darling.\" They protected Christopher Columbus. The Italians, now the Italians aren\\'t big on taking down Christopher Columbus. You take down those statues you can forget about the Italian vote. Do we agree? But they protected it. When asked at the debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal, and fracking, and natural gas, and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work, and they produce just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country, Biden said, \"No, we would absolutely not allow anything like that. We would make sure it\\'s totally eliminated.\" That\\'s what he said. He said, \"We would make sure it\\'s totally eliminated or eliminated.\" Now he\\'s coming and saying, \"This isn\\'t working too well. This isn\\'t working.\" And I made a speech a week ago in Texas. We had crowds that were unbelievable, on the highways, you can\\'t get in, but the highways, it\\'s like incredible. You could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money, go to eBay. Even as a used ticket, you could probably sell. But you go down the highways and you see it, and I was thinking of Texas, I\\'m making a speech in front of obviously people that like oil, they like God, and you know what else they like, they like their Second Amendment, right? So think about it. So whether it\\'s Pennsylvania, or Texas, or Oklahoma, or North Dakota, or any place, you take a look at this, right? And no oil, no guns, no God. I don\\'t think George Washington running with Abraham Lincoln as his VP, he\\'ll pick Abraham Lincoln as VP is going to win in Texas, or in Pennsylvania, or any place else with those three things eliminated. That\\'s what they want to do. They want to take away your Second Amendment. If I weren\\'t president, you would either have an obliterated Second Amendment or it would be gone entirely. I am standing between them and your Second Amendment. And that\\'s it. That\\'s it. They know. We put Baido in charge of guns. Baido is in charge, he wants to get rid of everything. Baido, that\\'s a beauty. Remember he said, \"I was born for this.\" Anybody that says they\\'re born for this. Remember Baido? He was on the cover of a magazine, I won\\'t mention the magazine, they\\'re back there. It\\'s a total phony magazine. But he was on the cover of the magazine. And he said, \"I was born to run for president.\" He was born for it. I was born. Anybody that gets that character. That was when he was doing well. Since then he\\'s cratered. Ever since he made that statement, he\\'s looked very bad. But take a look at what he says about guns, and he got put in charge of guns. So I guess Biden pretty soon he\\'s going to be coming out saying, \"No, no. I never said that.\" Check out all of the statements he\\'s made on everything and now he\\'s going the opposite way, but he\\'s agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he\\'ll do that. And then he figures later on, he\\'ll go. But everything he said is right, because he has no control over what\\'s happening. The radical left has captured the party. They even elected a person that nobody ever heard of, a senator, it\\'s been a while, against a young, good looking Kennedy by 10 points in Massachusetts. Did you know Kennedy lost in Massachusetts? You know why? Because he wasn\\'t a radical left. He was like a semi-normal person, just slightly left. No, but think of it. This is what\\'s happened. And this is really what\\'s happened. If you\\'re not a radical lefty, meaning guns, meaning fossil fuels, they want wind, wind. To make the windmill, which are made mostly in China, and in Germany, by the way, to make it, so much emission is let out, that is more than you can ever save. It\\'s just the craziest thing. Also, I am truly an environmentalist, but you have to understand. When we do things and they don\\'t, and we clean, and it\\'s very expensive to do that and they don\\'t, and we have this massive planet, and China, India, Russia, Germany, all these places, it\\'s fuming up and we\\'re doing our job and beautiful. No, they have to do it also. Otherwise, it just doesn\\'t work the way it\\'s supposed to. They want to ban straws. Has anybody ever tried those paper straws? They are not working too good. Right? They want to ban straws, I said, well, I\\'ve had a couple of meals at McDonald\\'s, et cetera over the years, right? Wendy\\'s, a friend of mine owns Wendy\\'s, I\\'ll give it a plug, right? Burger King. So they want to ban straws. I said, \"Oh really? What about the carton? What about the plate? What about the knives and the spoons that are plastic?\" Oh, they\\'re okay, but the straws we got ban. Has anybody ever tried, seriously, the new straw, it\\'s made out of paper, right? It disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie, this would have no chance. By the time you get finished, the straw is totally disintegrated. Does anybody walk around with a plastic straw? Because it\\'s that bad. You whip it out, boom, boom. You never had to do that. When asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda, you know what the answer is, right? It\\'s the Green New Deal, right? This Green New Deal. This was made up by people that don\\'t get it. Either that or people that just don\\'t like our country very much. But Biden replied yes, he\\'ll get rid of those jobs. And he famously told a voter, \"I want you to look in my eyes,\" when he\\'s not wearing the mask because I\\'ve never seen a man that liked their mask. Look, I\\'m all for it, we have a big weekend, distance on the weekend, and all of that stuff, and wear your mask when you\\'re close together in particular, and wash your hands, all those things. We have Labor Day Weekend coming up. But did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him? And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always, but a lot of times he has it hanging down. Because you know what? It gives him a feeling of security. If I were a psychiatrist, right? I\\'d say, \"This guy\\'s got some big issues.\" Hanging down. Hanging down. Congressman, give me your mask. I want to have it hanging from my ear. I don\\'t want to touch your damn mask. Mike I\\'ll never touch your mask. No, but the new one is, I went for a physical, the doctor said to me, \"Sir would you like to go over to Walter Reed? It\\'s incredible.\" By the way, the job they do on people that have been just really hurt, our heroes. The job they do is incredible. \"Sir would you like to go over and do a physical? You have some time.\" You know why I had time? Some deal, oh, it was China. I decided not to see China because I didn\\'t like the way they were doing business, okay? Does that make sense? So the doctor, White House doctor, highly respected, Sean, Sean Conley, \"Sir would you like to go over and do your physical, or do a piece of it, or finish it?\" or whatever it was, but do a physic. I said, \"I don\\'t know. I\\'m not in love with the idea.\" \"Well, if you do it, you don\\'t have to do…\" \"Okay. Let\\'s go. Come on.\" So we went, we went, and we\\'re driving. Now you have to understand, they\\'re like a hundred cars. You see what happens here. It\\'s like the plane times 50. So the cars are driving all over to about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital, I get out. I was there probably for an hour and a half, two hours. And then yesterday I read that I had strokes. CNN, fake news CNN right there. No, it\\'s true. Mini strokes they called them. I don\\'t know what a mini stroke is, but it\\'s not good. And there could be a day and I\\'ll admit, I said \"Hey, it happens all of us.\" Right? Except these young ones. It\\'s never going to happen to them. And I\\'d look at it at that, but you know what happens? But nothing happened. So I went in, I did that part of the physical. The end result was he\\'s very healthy. They were very unhappy when they heard that result. What you don\\'t remember is when this took place, it was a long time ago. They just started up because they want to try and get me to be in Biden\\'s physical level. They view me as being somebody that\\'s, I go around, hey, last week, this week, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, South Carolina, back to Washington. Let\\'s go here, let\\'s go there, let\\'s go everywhere. Meetings all the time. I think I\\'ve answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history. And mean questions. I watched Biden yesterday, so he hasn\\'t answered questions in what, two months or something. And yesterday he took a couple and they were set ups like I\\'ve never seen. One young woman who I think is there, one young woman is smiling, \"Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi. I just like to ask you, I\\'m sorry to bother you with this question.\" It\\'s the most incredible. So the doctor wrote a letter saying, \"No, this rumor is wrong.\" And I don\\'t like, rumors like that. And by the way, if it were a fact, it\\'s fine, it should. I think it\\'s an important thing. But if it\\'s not true, my wife was like, she came to me, she said, \"I think I would have known that.\" I said, \"Yeah, I think they would have known it too, because they drove back with me.\" The press follows me, they have a special deal, and then they followed me and then we go in, we go out. But if you remember, last time, I go in, I spend a little time, a physical like we all have. Hopefully you have them. Good thing to have I guess, as long as they give you a good answer. If they give you a bad answer don\\'t bother, possibly too late. But I go in, I come out a couple of hours later I guess, whatever it is, it\\'s a short time later, I get into the car, the press sees me get into the car. On my way home, I get a call from my wife, the First Lady who\\'s very popular. Do we like our First Lady? Very popular, great person, great woman. She said, \"Darling, are you okay?\" I go, \"Why do you ask?\" She said, \"They\\'re reporting that you had a heart attack.\" Now you have to understand I\\'m driving in a car, which is about what? Six cars in front of the press, because they have a big car. They\\'re a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible, make it uncomfortable. But they\\'re right behind me. So they know I got in and CNN reported that I had a heart attack. That was the same visit, and that didn\\'t work. No it\\'s unbelievable. CNN reported I had a heart attack so my wife was concerned. I said, \"No, not that I know of. And if I did, I think I\\'d be back there. No. I\\'ll be home in 15 minutes, darling. Thank you for caring.\" It\\'s always nice. It\\'s always nice. She sounded relieved. That\\'s good. When your wife sounds relieved. But she said, \" I wonder how that happened. Why did they do that?\" Because they\\'re fake news. So I go in and that rumor lasted for a little while, like a day or two. It lasted for a little while, no matter what I did. I\\'m in the same motorcade, I go in, and I go out. They know I\\'m in the motorcade, I actually have to report it, but I\\'m in the motorcade, and they said I had a… One of them said it was a massive heart attack. Think of it. Again, it could happen someday, okay? And when it does, I hope things work out. But they knew I\\'m in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news. Now for the same visit, that was the stupidest thing. From now on, when I go for a physical or something or go to the hospital, announce it because this was a quick thing. The doctor, he got me in a lot of trouble. He\\'s a great doctor. I said, \"No more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time.\" So now the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the New York Times who\\'s a third grade reporter writes a book and he said, \"The vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go,\" I guess, under anesthesia. Do they still call it…? In the old days they called it anesthesia. It\\'s essentially the same thing. I don\\'t want to get into a situation like where Biden used a record player. Remember that? You go home, you turn on your record player. But the anesthesia. And I said, \"How could that be?\" So remember, this is the same visit, same visit. They said heart attack a long time. All of a sudden out of this book. And he said, \"Suffered mini strokes.\" Now they get a letter from the White House doctor that said it\\'s totally false, totally false. But they still go with it, they go with it. And they know I\\'m in the group with them coming back. And I don\\'t know much about a mini stroke, but I assume Mr. Congressman, if you have a mini stroke, you\\'re not heading back to the White House, right? At least you\\'ll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital, right? So anyway, these are really dangerous people. They are so bad for our country. If we had honest press, it would be so great for the USA. It would be so great. They\\'re just a bunch of phony people. Not all of them. You have some very good ones, like about 10%. No, you have some very good ones, you have some great journalists, they know it\\'s phony stuff. They\\'re doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the White House and I just don\\'t think the public is going to fall for it. I don\\'t think the public is going to fall for it. In his best days, 25, 30 years ago, he was weak. He was weak. As a Senator, he was weak. He was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it\\'s not exactly primetime, I can tell you that. I just want to announce tonight because we\\'re joined with some very, very special warriors and Dan Meuser, Dan, thank you very much. Great job you\\'re doing. Dan, Congressman. He\\'s a Congressman who have really been warriors for me. You really have been. Thank you very much Dan. Fred Keller, Fred, thank you. Great job, Fred. The great John Joyce. Great, thank you, John. Guy Reschenthaler. Do you know him? Guy Reschenthaler. what are you doing over there? What happened? You don\\'t get along with these guys? Oh, okay. That\\'s good. Now I understand. That\\'s good. Glenn Thompson. Great job, great job Glenn, really great. And a real good friend of mine, right from the beginning, right, Mike? We were in Pennsylvania and a friend of ours, a Congressman, longterm, right? From Kentucky. No, from actually Tennessee came up to us, I was getting ready to make a speech, and Tennessee is very early voting. Remember what he said? This was four years ago. He said, \"I don\\'t know what\\'s happening in Pennsylvania. I don\\'t know what\\'s happening in the rest of the country. But if what\\'s going on in the rest of the country is like what\\'s going on in Tennessee?\" He said, \"They\\'re coming from the Hills, the roadsides, the rivers.\" He said they\\'re coming, people that never really cared to vote, they\\'re great Americans, but they never wanted to vote for the people that they were seeing. He said, \"They\\'re miles long. They\\'ve got Trump here, Trump hats, Trump pins,\" right? Tennessee. Duncan, Congressman Duncan, right? Remember that Mike? That was the first time. I mean, they said that they\\'d never seen anything like it. Tennessee has been incredible by the way. So Mike and I listened and we said, \"I wonder what that\\'s all about.\" But it is true. People that weren\\'t really political people, they\\'re coming in, and the deal here, like the Miss Universe, good old Miss Universe, right? Like this, they came with hats, they came with pins, they\\'re loaded with pins. One person had hundreds of pins. They never would\\'ve had a pin in their life, but they love the job that we\\'ve done and we\\'re going to do it even better in the next four years. Another great friend of mine who\\'s a tough cookie and a great Congressman. But unfortunately he\\'s a former because he\\'s just, I don\\'t know., He\\'s just a special guy and really has a big, beautiful heart, Lou Barletta, Lou. You look good Lou. Why don\\'t you run again Lou? And a man who is tough. There\\'s this guy. You ever hear of a guy named Conor Lamb? He\\'s like a lamb. So we heard, because he\\'s in sort of a Trumpy area, right? And we heard that he\\'s going to be for Trump, but he\\'s going to be fighting for Trump. I saw some of his commercials, I thought he was a Republican, right? Except when he got to Washington, he voted with Pelosi a hundred percent of the time. Craziness. He voted with craziness. And so we thought, this Conor lamb guy, he even voted to impeach your president over nothing. Zero. Zero. And that\\'s very personal. When they do that, that\\'s personal. And I have to say congressmen, 196 to nothing they stuck with us and so did the Senate other than Romney. You can have Romney I think. Remember he was walking with the Black Lives Matter saying, \"Yes, I\\'m a member of Black Lives Matter.\" Everyone said, \"That\\'s nice. Wonderful.\" He had a lot of mask on, I\\'ll tell you that. But we did a great job, it was an amazing thing. But this Conor Lamb was out there fighting it, and he shouldn\\'t have done that. And we have somebody that blows him away. He\\'s more of a hero, he\\'s tougher, he\\'s stronger, he\\'s smarter, he\\'s better looking, not that, that matters. Under the me too generation, I don\\'t talk about looks anymore. Looks don\\'t matter. Doesn\\'t make any difference. I don\\'t talk about looks. Me too. Me too generation. But I\\'ll tell you, this man is something special. He\\'s a real hero, a real tough guy, and he\\'ll never let you down, Sean Parnell. Just remember that Conor lamb, and I remember, because he\\'s like a lamb, he\\'s like a little lamb. Weak, got a lot of weak people. We like strong people, don\\'t we? We like strong people. We need strong people right now. We have somebody else in the audience who served as my Secretary of Energy and he was incredible. He was the Governor of Texas for what? 12 years I think. Rick right? 12? Tell me. 14? 14 years he was. And he was an incredible governor, and he was an incredible secretary, and he\\'s been an incredible friend. Rick Perry everybody. There was nobody that got into the race tougher than Rick. What he said about me, I\\'ll never repeat again. Even my own family didn\\'t like me when he got finished. And when he decided that I would be the one, he got out and there\\'s nobody that\\'s said better things about me. But you\\'re great Rick, and you did a fantastic job. Every place you\\'ve been, you\\'ve been great. Thank you very much. Rick Perry. Thank you. Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas? 00, the polls closed and they only announce if you\\'re way ahead. So they say, \"The polls have closed in the great state of Texas, Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas.\" … Hillary even beat this guy. Hillary. Hillary came in second in Utah. This week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from Brazil and from Mexico for the rest of the year despite the USMCA, sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them. So we stopped that. We\\'re reversing decades of the Biden betrayals that decimated Pennsylvania jobs, you know that. This state lost, listen to this, one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organizations, one of the worst things that happened, when China came in. They were flat-lined for many years, then they came into this crazy deal. They\\'re considered a developing nation, you see I\\'ve been sort of protesting that like, but they\\'re considering China as a developing nation, you get all sorts of things that you would never get, advantages over the United States. Well we have very strongly protested that. They\\'re not a developing nation, they\\'re a very powerful developed nation, and you know what? They got to pay what everyone else has to pay. Earlier this year I kept my promise to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well. Everyone said it will never happen, and I had great help from these gentlemen right here. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China\\'s pillaging, plundering and rampant theft of Pennsylvania and many other places, jobs. That\\'s all throughout the world by the way but our states have been just pillaged by China and others. Joe Biden\\'s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in America. After years and years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, it\\'s called America First. We\\'re America First, that\\'s enough, and we\\'re bringing our soldiers back home. You see what\\'s going on. After 19 years in Afghanistan, far away places, to bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunity zones, Tim Scott, great senator from South Carolina worked on it with me. Passed criminal justice reform, delivered permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities that Obama would never do and before the China virus we achieved the lowest African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment rates ever recorded by far. And they\\'re now heading back in that direction quickly. Democrat politicians have failed the black community for decades, they\\'ve failed the Asian community, the Hispanic community. They failed women. The numbers on women\\'s unemployment were the best in 61 years. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the American people. He was always for things that you wouldn\\'t want and now he\\'s changing, \"No, I never said that. I never said that.\" I\\'ve spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African-American community and for all communities and the best is yet to come. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds and on the subject of immigration, we\\'ve been fighting for that. Under my administration we achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we\\'ve deported 20,000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast. Thank you ICE. ICE and Border Patrol. ICE and Border Patrol. They don\\'t like ICE because ICE is, they\\'re tough. You got to be tough in that job by the way. Anybody up here like to work in ICE? I don\\'t think so. Let\\'s see, you could probably be okay but you\\'d rather do what you\\'re doing, right? I agree with you. These are tough guys, they have to be tough. These are bad, bad gang members. I mean you look at MS-13, you look at what\\'s happened with MS-13, you look at … We get them the hell out. Sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don\\'t even want to take a chance, they can come back in after what they\\'ve done, we had thieves, we had some very bad people in the VA and they\\'re all gone. Thank you, I love you too, thank you. Thank you. Such friendly voices. Quite beautiful. Only in Pennsylvania, right? Thank you. I withdrew from the last administration\\'s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, think of this. Obama paid $150 billion for a short-term deal. He gave $1.8 billion in cash. You ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in $100 bills? It\\'s a lot, it\\'s like the size of this, right? Now think $1.8 billion. How did you guys allow that to happen? They said we all voted against it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel. You never know nowadays, right? And I opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They\\'ve been trying to get that done for 52 years, I got it done immediately. By the way, as far as the capital of Israel, Jerusalem, they\\'ve been talking about many, many presidents. They all promised it, nobody did it. I did it. We get things done, and we just did something that is incredible. Even the New York Times gave it good reviews, not good reviews, beyond good reviews. Tom Friedman gave it phenomenal reviews, you believe that? That\\'s we achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades, a deal with Israel and the UAE. It\\'s a deal with Israel and the UAE and that\\'s going to lead and I\\'m going to tell you we have representatives over right now and other people are saying we want to get in that deal. You\\'ll have peace in the Middle East. We want to get the hell out. Let\\'s get them all back. Let\\'s get thel all back. Don\\'t forget, we\\'re energy independent. There used to be a reason. Now we do have a reason, it\\'s called Israel, and we have some very good partnerships over there. In all fairness we have some countries that have treated us very well and we\\'re going to take care of those countries, but we are energy independent for the first time and that\\'s a very good feeling. Our military has never been stronger than it is now. It\\'s new and it\\'s beautiful and I told you we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi, and separately, we killed the world\\'s number one terrorist, number one terrorist for decades and decades, Qasem Soleimani. We killed Soleimani. It\\'s a big step for the Middle East. We kept America out of wars. Remember they always said, \"Oh, this Trump. He\\'s radical, he\\'s really, I mean he\\'s off the … He\\'s too radical. He\\'ll get us in wars.\" I kept us out of wars, what happened with North Korea? Look, I get along with Kim Jong-un. They say, \"That\\'s terrible he gets along.\" No it\\'s good if I get along. If I get along with Russia, is that a good thing or a bad thing? I think it\\'s a good thing. These guys only fight to tie, they don\\'t fight to win, you fight to win. You look at what\\'s happening where they\\'re all coming back home. I even reduced in Germany because Germany, they\\'re an ally, but you know, they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military. So we removed a lot of soldiers out of Germany. They\\'re not happy, they said, \"This is going to hurt our economy.\" Well it\\'s good for our economy, okay? They thought it was going to hurt the German economy. Well, they don\\'t treat us right, they don\\'t pay their bills, they\\'re delinquent. You know what delinquent is? They\\'re delinquent. They don\\'t pay their bills. We protect them, they don\\'t pay their bills. We got to do something and they treat us horribly on trade through the European Union which basically they run. Together we\\'ve been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and Biden was there for every one of them. Joe Biden supported NAFTA, China\\'s entry into the World Trade. He supported the Korean deal, the Korean deal was so bad, it was so bad. This was a deal that was going to produce to South Korea done by Crooked Hillary Clinton, this was a deal that was going to produce 250,000 jobs. She said, \" This will be 250,000,\" and she was right, for South Korea. It produced 250,000 jobs. For us, we got nothing. We got losses, we got nothing. It was a terrible deal, I renegotiated, now it\\'s a good deal. They also gave and want to give mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Biden supported cutting Social Security. He voted for the Iraq War, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani, when I did that, he said, \"That\\'s a terrible thing. That\\'s a terrible thing.\" Everybody in the Middle East, they couldn\\'t believe it. They celebrated, some of them quite quietly I must add. Sign your mail-in ballot. You sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on Election Day or early voting, that is not tabulated and counted, you go vote, and then if for some reason after that, it shouldn\\'t take that long, it comes in, they\\'re not going to be able to tabulate it because you will have voted. But you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they\\'re going to beat us is by doing that kind of stuff. I\\'m trying to be nice. I\\'m trying to be nice. They want to send out congressmen 80 million ballots. Now there have been many races over the last year where they\\'ve done this and they\\'ve been a disaster. You look at New York, they had a congressional race, not a very good congresswoman, very untalented, I know her well, I lived in New York. She\\'s not got much going. They have no idea what the vote is, I think 20% of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said, \"What about me?\" He\\'s not too happy, her opponent. You look at what happened in Paterson, New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia, you look at what happened … There\\'s not a race, and these are small, these are easy to control. they want to send out 80 million unsolicited, I like it much better, they used to say universal, they used to say live ballots, I like the word unsolicited, and solicited. Solicited is okay, because that\\'s when you\\'re asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out, that\\'s okay. But you can\\'t, this whole thing with the unsolicited, unsolicited means you\\'re sitting there. We have a big enthusiasm edge, but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten ballots, they have. Dogs have gotten ballots and they know I\\'m right and everybody knows I\\'m right and they say I\\'m right behind the closed doors and it\\'s a disgrace, what they do to our country. 80 million unsolicited ballots. People that had no idea. People that weren\\'t going to vote in all fairness. It\\'s really unfair because our people have enthusiasm, they\\'re going out to vote. They\\'re all going out to vote. Everybody here going to vote? Everybody? They have no enthusiasm. So I said, \"So that\\'s unfair. That guy walks and then they\\'ll have somebody knock on the door, say, \"Listen, I would like your ballot.\" \"I don\\'t want to vote. I don\\'t care about Biden. I\\'m a Democrat. I don\\'t care about this guy.\" \"Well look, where is it?\" \"Here take it, blah blah blah.\"\" They even have a provision where you don\\'t have to verify signatures. What is going on? And they have another provision in some states where you can harvest, that\\'s where you grab them all together and drop them. In Nevada, they actually have a provision where they don\\'t have to be counted until seven days after the election. So that means if we have a close election, could be close, I hope it\\'s not, I hope we have a landslide like you\\'ve never seen. But if we have a close election that means Nevada has the right to, and I love Nevada, I think we\\'re going to win Nevada, except where they\\'re sending all these hundreds of thousands, millions of unsolicited ballots to people in Nevada and people that probably left a long time ago. It\\'s very unfair, it\\'s very unfair, but think of it. They have seven days after the election. Did you know that Mike? Seven days, what does that mean? I want to see the results of the election on November 3. By the way, if it\\'s anything like these other events, it could go on forever. I mean the congressional race which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done, they should make that a do-over and I think in Paterson they have a do-over. I think they\\'re going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud, theft. People were selling ballots, people were selling ballots, and you know they talk about Russia. They\\'re so worried about Russia. What about sending out 80 million ballots? That\\'s your real problem, and if Russia or China or these other countries want to cheat, all they have to do is forge ballots. It\\'s much easier than the way they have to go about it, right? So we have to put pressure on these people. Now the good news is we have a lot of court cases we have won in Pennsylvania, you know that, right? We have two judges, we have a state judge, we have a federal judge. I think both highly qualified judges from what I understand, I hear that they\\'re not too happy about what they\\'re seeing. So we\\'ll see what happens. We\\'re going to see what happens. The lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted, and if it\\'s not counted, vote, and then they have the job, if it comes in late, and if it\\'s not too late, they have the job of making sure that they don\\'t count it. But follow that ballot because these people, they\\'ll be lost, they\\'ll be gone, the numbers are incredible where they\\'re 25 and 30% off, 20% off. Follow your ballot. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. You know that. You know he always gets up today, \"COVID-19, COVID-19.\" I say, \"Joe, look. We got a country,\" and I agree with that and we\\'ve done a hell of a job. We\\'ve done a hell of a job. If you look at some of our numbers. You got to start talking about the economy and you got to start talking, your place, I mean this is … When you look at Pennsylvania, you\\'re in a shutdown. You have a governor that has you shut down we know the susceptible are old people, senior citizens, nursing homes. People that are old, especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes. We know that, we learned it, and we opened it up. But the problem these shutdowns are causing much bigger problems. You remember my original statement, right? The cure can\\'t be greater. It was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it\\'s so true. You have to open up this commonwealth, it has to be opened up. It has to be opened up now. But there\\'s what I think they\\'re doing, because you have the same thing in New York. We have a governor in New York who is 36,000 people died, 11,000 people in a nursing home because he made a mistake. He made a horrible mistake, and I built him a convention center with 2,800 beds and they didn\\'t use it and I sent up a ship, a great hospital ship, a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn\\'t use it and he requested it and then I said, \"You\\'re not using it. Why aren\\'t you using it?\" He could have put those people in the convention center in the hospital ship. What a shame how long can you do this for? Restaurant, poor guys. You can\\'t, how long can you do this for? The people are going to lose their jobs. They\\'re never going to open again. It\\'s not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world. It\\'s a hard business. New York is closed. You\\'re closed. North Carolina\\'s closed. Michigan\\'s … all Democrats. Let me tell you, what\\'s going to happen on November 4th. They\\'re going to announce their opening. They\\'re doing this for political reasons. They are. Right, John? They\\'re doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible, going into November 3rd, election day. Then as soon as the election\\'s over with, win, lose or draw for them, they\\'re going to open it. They got nothing. You know what? It\\'s a shame what they\\'re doing. For political reasons, they\\'ll be open. You\\'ll be open on November 4th, but you know what? From your standpoint, it\\'s very close to the election. It\\'s very far if you have a restaurant, and you can\\'t open your restaurant. You can\\'t open your store. It\\'s a disgrace and they ought to get together. They ought to do it. These are Democrat governors in all instances and Democrat mayors. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Thanks to the life- saving therapies that we pioneered, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. We\\'ve achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country, anywhere in the world. You never hear that from the fake news. They don\\'t want to talk to you about it. This is a big country. This is a tougher country to do that with, the European Union\\'s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours. If you look now, Spain is having a big blow up. France is having a big blow up. Now, we\\'ve done a great job, we haven\\'t been given credit for it. He always starts off, COVID-19. That\\'s all he knows. COVID-19. I said, \"What about the economy? What about jobs? What about all the other things we have to do?\" All he does, he thinks it\\'s a weak spot, and actually in theory, if we\\'re getting a fair shake from those people back there, it\\'s actually what the job we\\'ve done is actually a strong spot. That includes you people, with the ventilators that nobody had. Nobody that needed a ventilator, didn\\'t get a ventilator. Now we\\'re supplying them all over the world. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that. You don\\'t hear these numbers. Cases in the US have declined by 28% nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week. Three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials. Would have taken two years for another president. I was going to say a normal president, but they\\'ll hit me with … A little truth to that too. Now, but for another president, especially, in the last administration, they had the H1N1 pandemic. It was called Swine flu. You know, Joe always calls it the N1H1. He gets it mixed up. No, it\\'s the H1N1, Joee. Not that it matters, I guess. No. Do you ever notice, he\\'s always calling it the other. He calls it the opposite. He has no clue where he is, but he keeps saying, \"Oh, if he was,\" well he didn\\'t want the ban China, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning China. I was the only one that wanted to do it, actually. Then we banned Europe because I saw what was happening in Italy and Spain and France. We banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands. If I didn\\'t do the closing and the opening, so we\\'re at 175,000, far too … look, one is too much because this was given to us by China, and it\\'s a disgrace. It\\'s a disgrace. They could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into China, but not going to the rest of the world, including our country. It\\'s a disgrace. But think of it. Joe Biden got the worst marks you\\'ve ever seen for his handling of the H1NI Swine flu. They said it was incompetent, and the head guy, who now he\\'s trying to retract. It\\'s a little tough. That\\'s one great thing about the tape. He said it was horrible. He said, we did a horrible job. He said, they got lucky. It\\'s not contagious like this. We got, this is a tough one. I can look at that guy and he\\'ll catch it. Right there, and he\\'s very far away from me. It\\'s a tough one, because it\\'s so contagious. I tell you what, our Vice-President, Mike Pence, and the task force, headed up by Mike and working along with a lot of great people, they\\'ve done a fantastic job and they just get no credit. If I was a Democrat, a different president, and they did the same job, they\\'d say it was one of the greatest jobs they\\'ve ever seen. But take a look at what they say about the way they handled the Swine flu. It was a disaster. It was incompetent. They called themselves incompetent. They call, and now they\\'re coming in like, well, we would have done this and Biden by the way, was against, you remember, xenophobic, racist, because I closed down China. Then two months later, two and a half, three, and Nancy Pelosi was having dances in Chinatown, right? A month later. No, no problem. I was way ahead. Then Biden comes out and he actually said that I was right, but they said, \"Don\\'t say that, try doing it a little softer than that.\" He did it a little bit softer, but we were right. They were wrong. They handled it so badly. Just take a look, because we, I said to my people, \"We\\'ve got to fight this a little bit differently because we\\'re getting a lot of fake news, a lot of bad people saying things\", and you look at the stats and you look at how we\\'ve done compared to really much easier and much smaller countries, it\\'s amazing. If you took New York out of it, which was a disaster by Cuomo, if you took New York out of those numbers, we would have numbers that would be even better than they are. I could read numbers that would be even much better, because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because New York was incompetently run by Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. By the way, just today, there\\'s another credible thing happening. Pfizer, great company, announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks, very shortly. Incredible. Under Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine, in that record time that we talked about. This would have been years later. It\\'ll be delivered before, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October. How do you like that? Wouldn\\'t that be nice? That would be nice. You know why? Not because of the electric. It\\'ll be nice because we want to save people. That\\'s why it\\'ll be nice. That\\'s the important thing. Together, we will defeat the virus. The job we\\'re doing is, the job that all of the people working on it, our generals, our admirals, the distribution, we bought billions and billions of dollars of things, and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators. Very tough. The ventilator\\'s very complicated, very big, very expensive. It\\'s like, I made the statement, it\\'s like building a car, but more sophisticated. They said, \"No, it\\'s not.\" They said, they took a ventilator. They took it apart. These people are the worst, the worst. Over the next four years, we\\'ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That\\'s what we\\'ll do. Let me just tell you something. If they didn\\'t waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment, based on a phone call that was perfect, this stuff would have all been done. Would have all been done, truly. It would have all been done. Yet, with all of this stuff, the fake Russia witch hunt, the fake Ukraine. How about that? Did anybody read the transcript of that call? It was a perfect call. \"Hey, congratulations. Good luck.\" It was like a perfect call. Now they\\'ll take it back and they\\'ll say, \"Well, I don\\'t know.\" This was a per … In history, there\\'s never been anything like this. It was a totally lopsided, 100% political witch hunt, and it goes on and on. These are bad people. I really believe they don\\'t love our country. I watched Nancy Pelosi. \"You must wear your mask. You have to wear your mask, and we\\'re going to keep every beauty salon closed in California and all over the country.\" Then I see a picture. I say, \"Nancy Pelosi. Well, where\\'s the mask?\" I\\'ll tell you what. She must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly. She uses the salon and the salon turned her in? The salon turned her in. I don\\'t think I would have turned her in. I would\\'ve said, \"Well, you know, she\\'s a customer. I got to take care of my customers, right?\" But she made them open, and the salon turned her in and the salon did business with her. How much do they hate Nancy Pelosi? Then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that can\\'t be set up. She said, \"I was set up. I was set up by the salon owner. I was set up.\" I said, \"Tell me she didn\\'t say that, please.\" I just put out, that if she was set up, then she shouldn\\'t be leading the House of Representatives. I want the salon owner to lead the House of Representatives, because she set up … Think of it. She set up the Speaker of the House. That was a big mistake. As soon as I heard, she said, \"Well, she\\'s sent me up,\" Nancy, you\\'re not supposed to get set up. You\\'re representing our country. You know what she should have done honestly? She should have said, \"I made a mistake, sorry,\" and nobody would be talking about, this is like the biggest story. This is the big, crazy Nancy, highly overrated person. Let me just say she is a highly overrated person. They give her such good play. She is a highly overrated person. Look, they just turned off a camera because they don\\'t want me saying that. Just in closing, we will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement. Surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. We will not let them threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. We will end surprise medical billing. We don\\'t want surprise medical billing. You know what happens? It\\'s terrible, but we have ended it. Also, we\\'ve signed something that\\'s incredible. You\\'re going to see. Some people say it\\'s bigger than healthcare, and I signed it. Unfortunately it takes place on January 1st. You better elect me. You better elect me. It\\'s called price transparency. I said to my people at the end of the day, what is price transparency? This is going to lower your prices by 50%. You\\'ll be able to negotiate. You\\'ll be able to do things you\\'re not even allowed to do now, with hospitals, with doctors. You get better doctors, you get lower prices. I said, \"When does it start?\" It\\'s a complicated … Oh, did I get, I was fought. You have no idea. Right fellows? You have fought too. But they fought me on this price transparency. It\\'s bigger than healthcare, could be bigger than healthcare. But I said, \"When does it start?\" They said, \"Sir, we have it all set.\" \"When?\" \"January 1st,\" \"I said, I\\'d better win this election,\" because you\\'re going to see some unbelievable price reductions. That includes on drugs, because we\\'re reducing health insurance premiums massively, and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years, last year. But now it\\'s going to go down very big, because we did a favorite nation\\'s clause. I see the drug companies are, they\\'re killing me with ads. They have nothing but cash. They have nothing but money. They\\'re spending because they can\\'t believe … Germany and other countries pay much less than we do. We want to have, what we have to have, is we have to have a comparison of prices. That\\'s what it is called, favored nation clause. I instituted a favorite, so we\\'re paying $2.50 for a pill, and some nation is paying 25 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory, right? We get the 25 cent price. So, what\\'s going to happen that\\'ll go up. Ours will come way down. They can\\'t believe it. The drug companies can\\'t believe, and I will tell you, Mark Meadows is here, our Chief of Staff. Where\\'s Mark? They want to negotiate. They called. We signed it. It\\'s all done. They want to negotiate and they are negotiating, so let\\'s see what happens, but we\\'re going to get you cuts on prescription drugs, the likes of which you\\'ve never seen. We\\'ll protect Medicare and Social Security. They will not be able to protect it. It will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was dead. Now it\\'s the most vibrant space center in the world, by far. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and we\\'ll teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God, We Trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania us. It\\'s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington, who, by the way, they want all of the name, Washington removed from everything. I haven\\'t been keeping up with it. What did he do? George Washington, they want the name off. Congressman are we okay showing … I don\\'t think you liked that idea too much. George Washington. They want his name off everything, but we\\'ll keep it. I promise you this. As long as you canceled culture, you better have a strong president. Canceled culture. George Washington, can you believe? But he led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. This is the Commonwealth where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg and where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mined the coal, worked the railroads, forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of world. That\\'s in the history of the world and we are making it greater than it\\'s ever been before. That\\'s what\\'s going to happen. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country from these very, very deranged people. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving like never before. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, and together we will work very hard. The people of Pennsylvania, the great, great people of Pennsylvania, where I went to college. It\\'s a place I know very well. But, we will make America wealthy. Again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania.\\n'"
